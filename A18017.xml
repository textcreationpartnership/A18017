            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:7975:11"/>Moreouer, after this, hee much eaſed his afflicted ſpirite not onely in declaring what a floriſhing and happy Common-wealth hee would haue eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> if all things had anſwered <hi>(ad amuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſim)</hi> to his requeſt and dayly endevor: but alſo by many heauenly doctrines, learned Orations, wiſe ſentences, parables, and arguments, to diſplay and ſet foorth the manifolde <hi>vanities</hi> of wordly-men: and there-withall (as the wiſe Preacher) to ſtudie and endevor on the one ſide to diſſwade and hallow them from the ſame beeing repleniſhed with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miſeries: and on the other ſide, to allure and draw them on towardes the <hi>chiefe good</hi> and higheſt <hi>felicitie,</hi> where onely is found the true ſacietie and beſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, after all the confuſed troubles of this life. Truely this is the very Argument, Summe, or chiefe matter of his Booke, entituled the <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> or the <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,</hi> from whence as from the head-ſpring of many both pleaſant and profitable ſtreames, this preſent Solace is chiefly derived: In the which (beſides the viewe of <hi>Solomons</hi> Common-wealth, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters of right worthy requeſt) is contained his <hi>true Repentance</hi> and <hi>Pardon</hi> after his ſinnes, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in a certaine <hi>Dialogue</hi> or conference of his Princes, and chiefe Lordes. A worke both godly, pleaſant, and profitable, aſwell for <hi>Princes</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſonages, as for all others which have any deſire to walke (in this life) towardes the higheſt obiect of our hope. But heere I thought it good to admoniſh thee (gentle Reader) that as the worke chiefely regardeth thoſe matters of Antiquitie, and
<pb facs="tcp:7975:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
namely, ſuch as were either heard of, ſcene, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, or in action within the compaſſe of that time, wherein that moſt famous <hi>King</hi> both raigned and lived, and of the which his Princes, Lordes, and ſervantes coulde (as <hi>auriti,</hi> or <hi>oculati teſtes</hi>) both take and giue true teſtimonies: or the which they could readily cite, gather, obſerue, remember, conſider and reaſon of, in and among themſelues: ſo haue I therein (for the moſt part) taken, applyed, and vſed thoſe teſtimonies, examples, and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the which either that time, or the times then fore-paſt could happily affoord mee: for thoſe perſons from whoſe wordes, reportes and diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions this <hi>Dialogue</hi> is deduced, could not poſsibly deliver vnto vs, the things which as yet were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in action, or motion among men, ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues knew not (as they were men) what ſhoulde followe or come to paſſe after them vnder the Sunne:<note place="margin">Eccle. <hi>3.22.</hi>
               </note> but as they might conclude effects from the cauſes in naturall things. Therefore, I haue beene care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that there-with I might intermixe any of thoſe which ſucceeded in the ages, times and perſons fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, the which neuertheleſſe being extant may be neither reiected nor abandoned: but rather as they ſtand, to bee taken and collected, in and from the wordes, writings and workes of others, which though farre latter, have yet beene both godly, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, well learned, and of no leſſe credite and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in the Church. Howbeit, becauſe I would not; that any thing, which is either worthie thy knowledge, or heere in requeſt with any of them
<pb facs="tcp:7975:12"/>
that ſtand in doubt of the <hi>holyneſſe</hi> of <hi>King Solomon</hi> &amp; the authoritie of his <hi>wordes</hi> and <hi>Bookes,</hi> ſhoulde bee cowched in ſilence or buried in obſcuritie, I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (and God will, though very briefly) to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply even here, that which might ſeeme to bee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting there: that ſo, the latter compared with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and one thing conſidered rightly with another they may from either gather a meete harmony and conſent to conclude both for the <hi>holyneſſe</hi> of th'one, &amp; for the <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of th'other. But here I finde them that demaund, how the knowledge of this diſputation and conference ſhould be brought vnto mine vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding? &amp; from whence this princely <hi>dialogue</hi> could be either gathered or preſumed? To whome I might anſwere: that howſoever it be, that either this or the ſemblable matter may bee hidden from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and vnderſtanding of the ſimple, and ignoraunt or how hardly it may bee conceived of ſome wiſe and learned perſons: yea, and howſoever this preſent dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue ſhalbe cenſured and eſteemed in a great part, as proſopopoicall, or imagined, yet it is true and ſure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough (as it is hereafter declared and proved) that thoſe godly, wiſe, well learned and noble perſonages which were and lived in the time of <hi>Solomon,</hi> heard of his wiſedome and ſaw his glorie, never doubted of his <hi>holineſse</hi> and true <hi>repentance,</hi> and ſo neither of his <hi>remiſſion</hi> and <hi>ſalvation</hi> with the Lorde. And as in thoſe thinges they were not doubtfull: ſo were they neither ſo negligent, nor careleſſe of the Kinges health and proſperity, and of the Common-good of the
<pb facs="tcp:7975:12"/>
Lordes people: but that they (as moſt noble Princes and wiſe and grave Counſailors) entered into a deepe conſideration of the royal eſtate and of the common wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> reaſoned and argued the caſe in and betweene themſelves concerning the cauſes of the kinges great heavines and ſorrow: and therein did not onely thinke honourably and conſtre charitably and reverently of the kinges dealinges and wordes (as it well became them): but alſo endevoured by their wiſedom counſel &amp; authority to remove away all the cauſes, that the vnhappy effectes thereof might ceaſe and to withſtand the remedileſſe inconveniences of ſuch deſperate miſchiefs in time convenient, &amp; that in ſuch ſort in effect, as it is reported in this <hi>Solace.</hi> And to the end that no man might either make queſtion of the <hi>holineſſe</hi> of their ſoveraigne <hi>Lord,</hi> or doubt of his <hi>remiſſion</hi> and <hi>ſalvation,</hi> they argue for him, and above all the reſt of that moſt honourable ſociety, the moſt reverend father in God, namely <hi>Zadok the Lordes high prieſt,</hi> to whoſe grave and learned iudgement they all moſt gladly condiſcended, ſpake and proved firſt, that king <hi>Solomon</hi> was, by the providence of the <hi>higheſt,</hi> provided and made a lively figure of the moſt holy <hi>Meſſiah</hi> whom they faithfully expected to come into the world, and that it was neceſſary that the figure ſhould anſwere to the thing figured. Therefore the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> beeing moſt holy, it muſt follow that King <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhould bee alſo holy, alluding to thoſe equall proportions in the law between the <hi>Seed</hi> of the <hi>Woman</hi> and the types, ſhadows and figures of the ſame.
<pb facs="tcp:7975:13"/>
* Next to that, they argue his <hi>Pardon</hi> partly from Gods owne promiſe of mercy to him, and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of his divine Graces 2. Sam. 7.15. part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from his <hi>Repentance,</hi> the which (beſides other places) is worthily gathered of his Eccleſiaſtes or Preacher, beeing (as the Hebrewes ſay) the <hi>booke of his repentance.</hi> * Thirdly they argue his <hi>Salvation</hi> with the Lorde from the conſideration of his pardon as that which neceſſarily followeth the ſame, after this and like Teſtimonies and examples: <hi>Bleſſed is that man whoſe iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſinnes are covered: bleſſed is he, to whom the Lord imputeth not ſinne.</hi> And as they never doubted of the holineſſe, pardon and ſalvation of the perſon: ſo neither called they into queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any his books, proverbs, words, ſongs, ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tences, but honoured, reverenced and eſteemed them, as wiſe and grave ſayings, divine propheſies, and matters right holy and profitable for the Lordes congregation and for the inſtruction of his people. Therfore they thought it good, and no leſſe their duties, not onely to collect and preſerve them; but to commit and commende them with the like authoritie to the holy Church. Now it remaineth, that we alſo heare and conſider what hath beene elſe reſolved, concluded and teſtified by the godly learned and wiſe men aſwell hebrewes as others, ſucceeding them of that age and that not onely before, but alſo ſithence the birth, death and aſcention of the moſt holy <hi>Meſſiah</hi> concerning King <hi>Solomon</hi> and thoſe his wordes.

And to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare how well he liked the ſame houſe, he daily taught the people therin &amp; ſhewed them the right vſe therof: yea, hee much diſliked, that the ſame ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned by vngodly &amp; ſinful men, &amp; therfore aſſayed to reduce it to his priſtin purity, when with a whip he drave out both the buyers and ſellers, ſaying, <hi>My houſe, is the houſe of Prayer for all Nations:</hi> &amp; it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede all vnmeet that the thing which was ordayned for a figure of his Church, and prepared to ſo holy an vſe, ſhould be ſtayned with mens prophanitie, ſo long as the vſe of the figure endured, which was vntill the time of the comming of the holy <hi>Ghoſt</hi> vnto the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, after Chriſts aſcenſion into the heavens.

Whereas the neglect, or abuſe of this princely duty (which is often found in them which ambitiouſly aſpire for their proper pleaſures, vain glory or filthy lucre) hath occaſioned euen migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men in the world ſhamefully to couch and fall downe vnder
<pb facs="tcp:7975:22"/>
ignomy and finally to dye without any honour, as we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in the fearefull examples of <hi>Cain, Nimrod, Achitophel Ioab, Shimei, Adonia, Doeg</hi> and many ſuch like.</p>
               <p>But yet behold: After many proſperous and floriſhing daies of peace and pleaſing tranquillity, this wiſe king, euen <hi>Solomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> began more and more to decipher his infirmities and to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelfe (as indeede he was) a mortall, yea, a ſinfull man. For as <hi>Sathan,</hi> who had long time envied his happy ſtate and royall dignity, ſuggeſted euill in his heart, and tempted him, to ſinne againſt <hi>Iehouah</hi> his God, thereby entending to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme him &amp; his kingdome, as ſometimes he aſſayed to effect againſt righteous <hi>Iob</hi>: whereon the Lord, who had thus long ſtaide him vp with his diuine power, permitted him (at the length) to fal, that for ſome good cauſes to himſelfe wel known, howbeit within the compaſſe of ſuch a limit and meaſure, as he ſhould not defect and fall away from him for euer. But King <hi>Solomon</hi> was (as it were) for a time committed, I ſay not to <hi>Sathan,</hi> but to himſelfe, who beeing ſo left, notwithſtanding his excéeding great wiſedome &amp; ſoveraigne dexteritie in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſoone forgat himſelfe, his condition, his duty, and the law of his God: &amp; following after the ſenſuall humour of a humain mind and prave affection, he bowed his loynes vnto Women, yea to many outlandiſh &amp; ſtrange Women, contrary to th'x<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe commandement of <hi>Iehouah</hi> his God: whereby in his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der dayes, being quite ouercome in his bodie, turning away his hart from the Lord, and affecting thoſe vaine Gods, which his wiues worſhipped, he wrought wickednes before <hi>Iehouah</hi> his God, and walked not vprightly in his law: by doing whereof, he ſtained his honour, defiled his poſterity, brought wrath on his children, and felt ſorrow for his folly. For the Lord who had before graced and magnified him, being iuſtly prouoked, was very angry with him and in his fierce (yet iuſt) wrath not only minaced the diuiſion of his kingdome in the dayes of his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, namely <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> but ſtirred vp againſt him to that end, euen in his latter time, ſundry Satans or aduerſaries, who euer croſſing &amp; thwarting his peace &amp; purpoſes, drenched him with manie bitter potions, to the noyſome diſturbance of that bleſſed tranquillity which his name imported, th'exéeding
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7975:22"/>
ſorrow of his people dayly vexed with incurſions of enemies, and the continuall agony of his oppreſſed ſoule, which both day and night felt the gnawing of a reſtles worme within his conſci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And here we obſerue two memorable things for admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and inſtruction to all poſterities, firſt, what is the nature of man with his condition, when hee is left or committed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, not ſtayed or aſſiſted by the diuine grace. Next how little the Lord God regardeth them that turne their harts fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, how wiſe or magnificent ſoeuer they bee in their places before men. We know, how true and too often that is verified which King <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid in his godly meditations: that man being in honour hath none vnderſtanding, and therefore is compared to that Beaſt which periſheth. For thus <hi>Adam</hi> the Lord of the whole earth, beeing left vnto himſelfe with Lady <hi>Hevah</hi> his wife (though in the moſt bleſſed Pallace of pleaſant <hi>Paradiſe)</hi> within ſhort time tranſgreſſed the commaundement, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed folly. Thus Prince <hi>Noah,</hi> after his laborious trauails on the huge deluge, at length being at eaſe, and (as it were) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to himſelfe, was made druncken with wine, and lay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered before his children. Thus good <hi>Lot,</hi> after that <hi>Sodom</hi> was burned and himſelfe but a little refreſhed, fell into both the ſinne of drunkennes and inceſte. Thus <hi>Iſrael</hi> both in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, and in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> franked and pampered with proſperitie, wherein they too much admired their owne valour forgat the Lord, went a whoaring after ſtrange Gods and fell to ruin. <hi>Saul</hi> the late king plaied a plain rebell againſt the Lord (as <hi>Samuel</hi> told him) in the height of his wealth. Yea, thus <hi>Dauid</hi> the father of K. <hi>Solomon,</hi> being a whiles permitted to try himſelfe and his might, tranſgreſſed and confeſſed his folly. Lo ſuch is mans nature &amp; prave inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſemblant to the pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous lead or Iron, which declineth to the bottom of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereon it is caſt, when as it is not by ſome arte or meanes ſtaid from ſinking: or as the vine which groweth proud and out of courſe without timely pruning: yea, they be not vnlike (tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their miſfortunes) thoſe little Chickens, which runne forth to the Vultures; and the ſily Lambes which offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues a pray to the Foxes, without regard of their proper da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to kéepe or draw them away. Men therefore, yea the beſt and
<pb facs="tcp:7975:23"/>
moſt ſtrong men ſhould feare, and not deſire to bee left vnto their owne wils, wiſedome, power and habilitie: but pray and deſier to be continually protected, governed and directed by the diuine counſayles and providence, knowing that God beeing their Father doth euermore care and prouide for them, which being humbled in his feare depend on his will &amp; direction. Next y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, we ſée that the Lord neither bleſſeth nor graceth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which leaue him and his ſervice, how mighty, wiſe, rich or glorious ſoeuer they be: but in this he eſtéemeth the king as a Caytiffe, the Emperour as a wretch, the rich as a beggar, the wiſe as a foole: nor will he vouchſafe them honour, who diſhonour him. Nor indeede hath he freed his own from the touch of miſerie in meaſure, when they tranſgreſſed. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Hevah</hi> were exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Paradiſe: Noah</hi> was wade aſhamed: <hi>David</hi> mas floyſed with many afflictions. So neyther will the Lord that any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of whatſoeuer eſtate or condition, ſhould aſſure himſelfe of peace and proſperity longer, then whiles hee liueth in peace with his maker,<note place="margin">King Solomon began now to know his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and to returne.</note> dependeth on him by faith in <hi>Meſſiah</hi> and ſerueth him in ſingleneſſe of heart. All this the King at length wiſely conſidering (by the bleſſed motion of the diuine Spirite, which now began to reclaime, and call him home againe:) ſodainely altred the conſtitution of minde and changed his behauiour (as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, after that the Lord created a new heart, and renewed the right ſpirite, within him) And thereupon he became euen as another man. For now, knowing both his heynous tranſgreſſion, and the danger of his own poore ſoule: foreſéeing the imminent alteration of his high eſtate, and the great perill of his people: and féeling the heauy ſinger of that iuſt God, and his dreadfull wrath already burning as a conſuming fier in his conſcience; he was as a man ſtricken with a deadly arrow, he waxed both pale and wan in the fearefull agonies of his moſt ſorry ſoule, that face which ſhined ſometimes as a bright Angel, was deformed with the aboundance of his watry teares: and whereas he vſed to ſit royally on his ſtately Throne, he did now chooſe to lye all alone on the cold earth: he wayled all the day, and watched euery night, rent his kingly cloathes &amp; caſt aſhes on his head: mingled his drinke with his teares,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7975:23"/>
and watred hid cowch with the ſame, ſighed ſorily, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented wofully: abandoned as donge all his former pleaſures and contemned as vanitie the delights of men. Moreouer all his words, which were before ſo pleaſant and hony ſweete to the hearing, now ſauoured of mortification and ſorrow, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the vnmeaſurable torment of his wofull ſoule. Alas!<note place="margin">The fraile co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of mans nature.</note> who would haue thought, that ſuch a noble perſon could haue beene ſo ſodainely turned about and altred? Who could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that ſuch paſſing great pleaſures ſhould be determined in paines? ſuch comfortatiues conuerted into coraſiues: ſuch gladneſſe into griefes: ſuch proſperitie into aduerſitie: ſuch felicitie into miſery, in ſo ſhort a time, in ſo noble a perſonage? But yet we may marvaile the leſſe, if we duely conſider not onely that the King (though ſo Wiſe, Rich, and Glorious) is yet but a Man, to whom are incident both ſinnes, ſly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings &amp; falles: but alſo that ſuch are the miſeries, infirmities, afflictions and conditions of this life: And that whenſoeuer the Lord God in his iuſt iudgements either openly or ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beateth and puniſheth a man for his faults, that man is all vnable either to withſtand thoſe ſcourges, or to abide in his honour or proſperous eſtate, to retaine his health or wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare either of body or minde, being worthyly conſtrained to cowch and giue place to him which is much ſtronger then he, and to yeelde to him with whom no man can pleade, nor anſwere one for a thouſand, (as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaid in the like conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.) With this I call to minde that which the Kings Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was wont to modulate, ſinging vnto the Lord his God:
<q>
                     <l>When thou for ſinne a mortall man doeſt beate,</l>
                     <l>He waues away, and waxeth woe, and wan:<note place="margin">Pſal. 39.12.</note>
                     </l>
                     <l>Much like the garment, which the moath doth freate:</l>
                     <l>So vaine a thing (indeede) is mortall man.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Lo, here may we ſee the fickle condition of man, &amp; the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his proſperitie in this life! Well may he be compared therein to the flower of the fielde (as both <hi>Iob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A ſimilitude which ſetteth forth mans condition. Iob. 14.1.</note> and <hi>Dauid</hi> faith:) for like as the flower is not onely ſed and refreſhed with the pleaſant ſhowers of raine, &amp; the comfortable beames of the Sunne, and groweth and ſhineth in the beauty of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers colours, but alſo, within a very ſhort time, is annoyed

altred, and deformed now with the pearching heate of the <hi>Canicular</hi> Starre, then with the pinching froſts of <hi>Boreas</hi> windes: Euen ſo is man: for he commeth vp, he floriſheth, he ſhineth, he is glorious in his place, ſo long as it pleaſeth God to giue him the ſweete beames of proſperitie and honor in this world: but this is not permanent: for as man will not abide in honor, ſo neither is it meete he ſhould be ſtill fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred and lulled here in the cradle of felicitie: for by this, he forgets himſelfe and his eſtate: yea, he forgetteth God that made him, and forſaketh the ſame which redeemed him: Therefore the Lord is beſt pleaſed, that he ſhould be exerciſed with thoſe afflictions which commonly follow after worldly pleaſure and proſperitie, being indeede as a common prono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtication of ſorrow and aduerſitie. Neither is there any thing to be looked for in this life, as both the ſayings of the wiſe, the ancient hiſtories, the proper ſimilitudes of things, and the preſent examples of ſuch euents doe plainely teach and inſtruct vs. In the ſenſe and experience therefore of theſe things, what is there found of any conſtancie, or of any ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or of any continuance in mans life? As man himſelfe is fraile, ſo are all thoſe accidents appertenant to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, tranſitory. Therefore, not onely the poore man, but alſo the rich man: yea, not onely the beggers, but the moſt Royall Princes are ſubiect to this alterations and vanities. In the due conſideration wherof,<note place="margin">Good counſell for them that liue in this world.</note> men ſhould not ſo much mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile at the ſodaine chaunges of others, and at the inconſtancy of theſe worldly things, as they ſhould endeuour to learne to beware that they depend not on the deceaveable vanities of this life: and to take héede, that they waxe not proud, nor forgetfull of their maker, and of their owne eſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the fond abuſe of the things which are not their owne, but as lent vnto them to be vſed to the honor of God &amp; their owne neceſſities.

that ye be ſo penſive and heavy to day? Is all thing well?

But howſoeuer it be, I tell you here in Councell, that the King is in a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate agony of minde, then the which nothing can bee more noyſome to his health. For as the trée cannot proſper whoſe roote is annoied: ſo neither can that perſon receiue health, which hath a penſiue ſoule. I am very fearefull to thinke whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this will come: and doubtles the kinges enemies, hearing hereof, they will clap their hands hiſſing and wagging their heads vpon him, as the baſe abiects ſometimes did on holy <hi>Iob</hi> with this bitter taunt: <hi>Is this that man whome all the world ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, for wiſedome, wealth, glory and fame</hi>? But on th'other ſide the kings people ſhall haue little cauſe to eate, drinke and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce vnder their vines and figge trées, as they haue done in thoſe dayes forepaſt, vnder our Kinges happy Raigne.

Oh good God helpe vs! he ſaid againe. The peace, proſperity and well-fare of all <hi>Iſraell,</hi> doth depend, (next to our God) on the peace, proſperitie and well-fare of our moſt gratious King <hi>Solomon,</hi> whom <hi>Iehouah</hi> his God hath choſen and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to repreſent his own glorious perſon in our happy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, in his wiſedome, his iuſtice, his equity, his benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, his fortitude, his magnanimity, his piety and all other his princely vertues: no leſſe then the faire and bright Sunne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth his Maieſtie in the high Heauens, to the ioy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Creatures: or, as doth the head on the naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the bewtie, life and gouernment of the ſame: or as the wiſe Gouernour of a Shippe in the Sea to the direction and ſafety both of it, and of all thoſe embarked therein. Therefore I ſay, if the Lord of heauen in his diſpleaſure, ſhould take away our ſhadow, or abridge our king and his honourable proſperity for tranſgreſſion and ſinne, who, from thencefoorth, ſhall haue peace? who ſhall fare well? who ſhall proſper? how can that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

Howbeit, we may worthely dread (as the King himſelfe alſo dreadeth) that thoſe vnthriftie daies approach too neere vs. Surely, ſurely, now of late as we haue plainly perceaued a ſtrange alteration and wonderfull chaunge in the Kings perſon, who appeareth as moſt loathſome to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, weary of his owne life, negligent of his owne health, careleſſe of his royall glory, and hatefull of the world, as drooping towards the end of his daies (for this may any one diſcerne in him, which ſhall either heare him to ſpeake, or ſée him to goe:) ſo the high renowne and bright beawtie of our time and nation beginneth to vale the bonnet, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, as from the higheſt to the loweſt, and will (indeede) yer long be ſhadowed and diſgraced with ougly deformitie, without ſpeedy preuention: Let vs therefore conſider of our preſent time,<note place="margin">When men be in the greateſt daunger they ſtriue with the more careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to wind out</note> the condition of our eſtate and the daungers which are imminent, and in regard thereof, not diſdaine nor omitte to imitate and followe the examples not onely of men, but alſo the bruite creatures in this caſe: for behold; they and euery of them in their kind and nature commonly ſtruggle and ſtriue with the more diligence and carefull regard, when they be in hazard of hurte, then when they be free from all perill. If any fall into the fier, the water, or into ſome lethall or deadly ſickeneſſe or other miſchiefe, firſt of all he is made afraide, then he is pained, then he looketh about him, then he groaneth, then he laboureth to eſcape, this if he cannot doe, then he crieth, then he craueth the counſell and aide of others wherſoeuer &amp; whence ſoeuer he may get it: in the end, he gréedily catcheth holde of whatſoeuer helpe is proffered him. And wee haue ſéene, that many by ſuch meanes haue eſcaped great dangers and loſſes: On the contrary, we haue knowne many to periſh and decaye, which haue béene either ſo fooliſh as that they haue not ſéene their owne danger, or ſo negligent as they would not labour &amp;

Thus alſo <hi>Baruch</hi> the noble Captaine harkened to wiſe <hi>Deborah,</hi> &amp; gat the victorie ouer Gods enemies. Thus <hi>Pharao</hi> (though a tyrant) craued aide of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to be deliuered from thoſe plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> &amp; K. <hi>Saul</hi> permitted little <hi>David</hi> to enter the field againſt huge <hi>Goliah,</hi> for <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels</hi> glory. On the otherſide, the reprobate <hi>Cain</hi> would neither know his danger, nor be reſtrained of his purpoſe, and being in diſtreſſe, would not vouchſafe to craue or ſéeke for aide, whereby he periſhed, a vagabond and exile from the Lord of heauen, who caſt him off from his grace and mercy. Thus the filthy <hi>Sodomits</hi> ſtroken with blindneſſe would neither thinke of their deſtruction, nor craue, nor admit the aduiſe and aide of righteous <hi>Lot,</hi> who had vexed his ſoule among them, nor any thing regarded the prayer and meanes of faithfull <hi>Abraham</hi> for their ſafetie: to be ſhort, <hi>Saul</hi> the King diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained <hi>David</hi> and his comfort notwithſtanding he had taken ſo good experience of his integritie and the power of <hi>God</hi> in him, therefore rather then he would ſéeme to embrace him and his power, he choſe to kill himſelfe with his owne ſword to the daunger of his ſoule and decay of his glory.

And becauſe the <hi>God of heauen</hi> is the ſame from whome, and by whome all good thinges deſcend &amp; come vnto his children, and which both comfortes and helpes them indeede in all their afflictions and dangers, let vs (as I ſaid before) lift vp vnto him both our hearts and eyes, and thus let vs pray and ſay as the kings father hath taught vs in the like caſe.<note place="margin">Pſal. 20.</note>

the pleaſures and delights of the ſonnes of men, hee in the ende (afer long ſearch and ſtudy) found therein nothing of habilitie to content his minde: but this hee found, that all thoſe his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and endeuours were meere vaine and grieuous to his ſoule: and ſo much the ſooner for that hee conſidered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>the wiſe ſhalbe no more in remembrance then the foole: &amp; that it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the wiſe as to the foole</hi>:<note place="margin">The wiſe man is forgotten in the world.</note> therefore what encouragement hath a man to ſeeke for wiſedome?

The King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of this alſo, that <hi>Vngodlineſſe is found in the place of

Howbeit hee thought (as he ſaith) that the cure of this malady being beyond mans power and wiſedome, <hi>God would in the due time take on himſelfe and ſeparate the righteous from the vngodly, and then ſhall be the time and iudgement of all counſels and workes.</hi> Hee alſo much muſeth, how God (though he had choſen of the children of men) ſhoulde neuer the leſſe permitte them to appeare,<note place="margin">God ſuffereth men to appear as the beaſts.</note> as though they were but Beaſtes: and as ſomewhat doubtfull of the eternall beeing of mans ſoule (which is that ſpirituall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which God hath made afer his owne likeneſſe, and powred into the humane body, and ioyned to the body doeth animate &amp; guide it, but being ſeparated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body, dieth not,<note place="margin">The fleſhly mans iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſoule.</note> but liueth immortall for euer) he ſaith: <hi>Who is he which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſpirit of man that goeth vpwarde: and the breath of a beaſt that goeth downe to the earth</hi>?

part of the cauſe of the kinges ſorrow and trouble hath ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, or beene taken from ſome of vs, that haue beene and are daylie ſo neare and about his royall perſon. Therefore it ſhall not be amiſſe (in my iudgement) that wee firſt examine our owne wordes, workes and dealinges, and with an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right conſcience, trie and iudge our ſelues ſecretly with our ſelues, and finding with vs any part of the cauſe, or th'occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this diſpleaſure, that we endeuoure ſpéedily, and ſéeke how to recure or mitigate the ſame: leſt whiles we delay, the king be ſo ouercome in thoſe his perilous paſſions, that hee may be hardly recouered.</p>
               <p>After that thoſe forenamed Lordes had thus ſpoken, euery of them in his turne,<note place="margin">zadock.</note> 
                  <hi>Zadock</hi> the Prieſt opened his mouth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and with great grauity vttered theſe wordes in effect. And my ſelfe (alſo my Lordes) haue with theſe mine eares, heard thoſe and others the like words to bée ſpoken by our moſt Soueraigne Lord: But yet (as I haue conceiued &amp; thereof duely pondered) the King in ſuch his wordes by you before remembred and recorded, hath not ſpoken of vanitie,<note place="margin">Solomon hath not vſed any vaine talke.</note> that is, hee hath not vttered any vaine or idle thing, nor hath his tongue talked of deceit, but hee hath wel refrained that, and will doe (as he hath proteſted with patient <hi>Iob)</hi> as long as his breath is in his body: for, as the King is of al other the wiſeſt, ſo hath he had (eſpecially ſithens the time that thoſe paſſions afflicted him) a due regard both of his place and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. And truely (in my iudgement) he hath made, and yet dayly maketh and augmenteth, <hi>A Catologue of mans vanities vnder the Sunne,</hi> right worthy to be lamented and abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And by this he would that men ſhould learne to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the wicked world, with the pompe and vanities thereof:<note place="margin">The deceit &amp; vanitie of the world.</note> for why? he hath found, and yet perceiueth the world to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deceitfull, the euent horrible, and the paine thereof intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, wherein not to feare, not to lament, not to be afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not to bee in perill, not to bee tormented, it is moſt impoſſible. Surely, as the King could not finde, ſo neither can I report any good or profitable thing of the <hi>World.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O ye louers of the world, for whoſe ſake yee ſtriue and make warres, your hope can bee no greater, then
<pb facs="tcp:7975:36"/>
that yee ſhall be made the friendes of the worlde: and what gaine ye by that? ſurely, yee ſhall finde therein, that the fleſh will infect you, Sathan will deceiue you, and the worlde herſelfe will daunt you: beſides that, the world paſſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with her luſts: and if yee loue thoſe thinges that be hers, yee ſhall paſſe away with her and her luſtes, and through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perils ye ſhall fall at length into eternall torments. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would our king, that yee ſhould leaue and contemne all thoſe vaine things of the world which periſh, as that wherof ye can gather no profite at all in the end, but paine and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes vnſpeakable. And ſurely, neither hath the king ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or done this without the argumentes of many godly and diuine motions of minde, from whence, as from the treaſure-houſe of a godly wiſe man, he hath brought foorth many hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Oracles and ſweet Sermons tending to the <hi>higheſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the euerlasting God, and the chiefe felicity of man</hi>: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worthily eſteemed the two principall endes of mans ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and creation, the which is to be inquired, ſought after, and effected in the feare of God, and the obſeruation and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his commaundementes, according to that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord, which <hi>David</hi> the Kings father receiued from his ſpirite, and committed vnto <hi>Aſaph</hi> that excellent ſinger:

                  </q>
I thinke (vndoubtedly) that this ſodaine Metamorphoſis of the king,<note place="margin">The former good counſell approued by zadock.</note> is not occaſioned by any of vs here preſent.

leaſt forgetful, they haue not onely neglected the duties of their vocations, but miſſed the right ſcope of their life, and ſo the higheſt happineſſe. But would to God, that the king were now, as he was ſometimes in thoſe monethes paſt,<note place="margin">Iob, 29.2.</note> and in the dayes when God proſpered him! when his light ſhined vpon his head, when he went forth after the ſame light and ſhining, euen through the darkenes, as it ſtoode with him, when hee was young, when God proſpered his houſe, and when the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty was yet with him, and when hee had, ioy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in that his proſperity amongſt vs and his people! Then ſhould not ſorrow oppreſſe his heart, nor dread of future dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers daunt our hope. But let the Lord be true (as hee is) and euery man a lyer: that ſo hee may worthily bee extolled in his iudgements, and prayſed in his mercies: which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe is not the leaſt cauſe, that God in his wiſedome hath ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red many of his Saintes (which haue been and may ſtand for ſingular examples of pietie and godly vertues vnto vs) not onely to ſhew forth their humaine imperfection and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by ſome certaine ſlidinges and blemiſhes, but alſo to taſte of afflictions cuppe, aſwell for a correction of their faults, as for an exerciſe of their ſpirites, no leſſe neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnto man, then his daily foode in this wretched worlde.</p>

               <p>But now, as hee is faithfull which performeth that in déede, which in worde he hath proteſted and promiſed:<note place="margin">Zabud his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie.</note> ſo reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend <hi>Zabud</hi> (who firſt ſpake thereof) beganne in this ſort to performe it accordingly.

In the which point it were an ingratefull part in me, and nothing beſéeming the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines and honour of my place, if I ſhould in ſuch ſort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue my ſelfe, eſpecially towardes him or them by whoſe rich bountie I haue beene preferred, aduanced, and am dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie benefited and fauoured: yea, I confeſſe, I might well bee numbred vppe among thoſe fooles, that haue crooked ſoules in vpright bodies, for whome worſhippe is ſo vnſéem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the ſnow for the Summer, and raine for the harueſt: whome, whoſoeuer ſhall place in high dignity, ſhall binde a ſtone in a ſling to hurt himſelfe.

I am ſet in an high place, and enioy therein like fauour of my Lord the King. This I confeſſe, I doe prayſe God for the ſame, and ambolden to be right thankfull to my Soueraigne.

I haue been (as holy <hi>Iob</hi> hath taught me) an eye to the blinde, a ſtaffe to the lame, an eare to the deafe, a mouth to the dumbe, and a father to the fatherleſſe.

To be ſhort, I haue as much (as lay in mée) endeuoured in my place to diſcharge my duetie, to benefite my Countrie to ſerue my King, and to glorifie the Lord of heauen.

<pb facs="tcp:7975:39"/>
thus (indeed) I ſhould declare my ſelfe to bee eſteemed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie this place and office. For I perſwade, that as thoſe props and ſtayes in an houſe, which are eyther noyſome, rotten, or vnprofitable, ſhould of neceſſitie be remoued, that ſome ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and more commodious might be placed in the ſame: ſo al ſuch perſons which ſtand in place,<note place="margin">VVhat perſons are moſt meete for authority.</note> as to ſupport, ſtay vp and maintaine the eſtate and honour of their Prince and common wealth be remoued and excluded both from his fauour and al authority, which wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the feare of the Lord, &amp; thoſe heroical vertues which are ſo needefull and commendable in ſuch perſons, which extend not their forces to the due ſeruice and honour of th'one and benefite of th'other, and ſuch other to be preferred &amp; ſet in their places &amp; beſt fauoured, which are both wel qualified, and ready to perform their right offices in either, as ſuch, whereof the king at all times, and vpon all occaſions, may happily take and receiue counſel &amp; comfort, &amp; the common wealth ſafety &amp; vtilitie. *Therfore among (many other things) as the king hath not onely placed me in office ouer all his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyours &amp; Cators for his houſe, and ſworn me to do &amp; obſerue my duty truſtily therin,<note place="margin">The office of the Purueyor.</note> with this eſpeciall charge, that neither they, nor any other his ſeruantes ſhould oppreſſe, wring or wrong his ſubiects vnder colour of taking or making prouiſion for his houſe, Knowing how ſoone a Prince by ſuch meanes may become hatefull to his Subiects: I haue prouided char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and regarded, that both the ſaide Purueyors and their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants be men of good report, and faithfull and true dealing perſons, and that they be duly ſworne to reſpect the kings co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and to execute their offices accordingly. Next I haue regarded, that none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould preſume to go forth with out his lawful warrant or commiſſion ſealed with the Kings ſeale, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end, that both the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues might know and remember their charge therin, &amp; the people might neither ſuſpect their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority nor feare of the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of their dealings. Thirdly, I haue ſtraitely charged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the kings name, that they exact not, nor wreſt any thing from the Commons but vpon agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at a reaſonable price betwéene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the owner of the things to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp. And that if any thing be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on credit for the king to be paid for at a day appointed, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perueiors ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7975:39"/>
receiued thoſe monies out of the kinges Exchequer doe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conuert the mony to their owne vſe, nor deteyne it from the Creditors, nor delay to ſatiſfie them at the ſaide daies. And becauſe all places of the Country are not ſtored with victuals and ſuch other things alike, I haue prouided and charged that prouiſion for the kings houſe be made in ſuch places where the moſt plentie of thoſe thinges are, and that at méets and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient times, and at ſuch reaſonable rates &amp; prices, as the ſeller may wel afoord the ſame, without threates or violent ſpeeches. Alſo, that the purueiors ſhal not for fauor, fine or bribe, forbear to take of one man more then of another, whoſe goods are ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their authoritie at méete prices: nor ſhall charge or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acte of one man more then of another, for any malice, euil-will or ſuggeſtion of friendes or acquaintances. To bee ſhort, as they are ſworne to obſerue and perfourme the kings comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement and their duty therein: ſo haue I duly examined them &amp; their dealings from time to time. And if any haue béene founde faultye or offenſiue in this caſe, I haue not onely abhorred and baniſhed them the Court, but ſeuerely puniſhed them, as capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall enemies to the king and his people. Moreouer, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the prouiſion of mine owne houſe, I haue had no leſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, that none of my Cators or Officers ſhoulde at any time exact of the kings ſubiects and kind of victuals, Corn, Cloath, Cariages or whatſoeuer els without the good wills and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of them whoſe the things be, and without making a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full bargaine betweene them for the ſame, nor yet without preſent paye according to their agréements, and that whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer I found any of my ſeruants or officers, whether for their filthie lucre, or mine owne commodity, to offend in their dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, I haue neither defended them, nor fauoured them, nor wincked at their faults, but I haue reproued them, caſt them out of fauaur, depriued them of their offices and ſeuerely puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed them yea, I haue compelled them to reſtore and yeelde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the true owners the treble valew of ſuch goods ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp with like coſts of ſuite, beſides their amerciame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to the kings Maieſtie at his pleaſure. Truely, this ſhould be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the Nobles, and ſo much the ſooner, that the commons might not be moued to murmure, but to commend their dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb facs="tcp:7975:40"/>
that their owne conſciences, might neither accuſe nor condemne, but excuſe and cleare them: the poore people might not curſe, but bleſſe them: the kings grace might not be offended but well pleaſed with them: and the Lord of heauen might not in iuſtice plague, but in mercy proſper them in their honour. Thus haue I done and duly regarded, and for my part, I would not wiſh to liue, much leſſe to liue in this honour, lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then I am able, or at the leaſt haue a faithfull deſire both to aduance the true honour of the eternall God, preſerue and maintaine the moſt worthie Maieſtie of my Soueraign Lord, benefit the common-wealth and diſcharge my duty in my place. *</p>

I haue not beene of that couetous minde, and of that baſe and corrupt nature to conueigh the Kings Treaſure into mine owne cheſtes for any my priuate vſes: the which yet, is the only end for the which ſome men hunt after &amp; ſeeke for ſuch Offices, little caring how the king or the commons do either proſper or decay: Nor haue I waſted, ſpoiled or ryotouſly ſpent or conſumed the royall wealth: as ſome haue done, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting rather their owne pleaſures, then the kings profit, to the abuſe of this authoritie: nor haue I purchaſed in large landes, builte vp ſumptuous houſes, endowed my wife,
<pb facs="tcp:7975:44"/>
exalted my ſonnes, married my daughters, or otherwiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for mine houſe and poſterity, with that which I haue receiued for the King, &amp; the which (without his eſpecial war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to the contrary) is onely to be employed, or kept and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued to and for his Maieſties vſe and the affaires of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, I haue neither deteined nor withholden that, which I haue beene willed or commaunded by the King to diſburſe and payfoorth, as if the things were mine own to bee vſed and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, nor vnder colour of mine office and authority, haue I extorted, exacted, or encroched that of the kinges people, which was neither due to his Maieſtie, nor lyable in right to my commiſſion or authority. But why ſhould I be prolixe and tedious in declaring further what I haue not béene, and what I haue not done, that might bréede offence? It is enough for me to tell you that I haue executed mine office, and done my duety faithfully to the vttermoſt of my power. I haue kept and preſerued the Royall treaſures for the honour of his Maieſty, the weale of his Realme, and the daunting of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, with a good conſcience: and as there was neuer king more rich: ſo was there neuer any more carefull in preſeruing and more héedefull in well employing the wealth of the ſame. It is wonderfull to reckon vp what hath béene receiued, and againe, to tell what hath beene paide out, in and about the kinges buildinges of his Temple, of his houſes, of his Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, of his Townes, of his walles, and about many other thinges. The dealers in and about theſe great matters may neither be ignorant, nor inexpert, nor negligent. In al the which (I ſay) I haue dealt yet as iuſtly, and as carefully as I might: howbeit not without great toile, trauell, and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning both of mind and body. But yet I haue beene glad and ready thus to imploy my ſelfe, ſo far foorth as therein I might pleaſe my Lord the king, and diſcharge my duety towardes him in this ſeruice. And truely in all theſe great dealinges, as I haue beene faithfull, and therein diſcharged mine oath &amp; conſcience both to God and the king: So did I neuer (as yet) eyther heare, or obſerue in the king, that hee was diſpleaſed with mee for any mine actions or doinges therein. Neither belieue I, that at this preſent hee hath taken any iuſt conceite

Therefore knowing mine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnes, I ſtand to be tried, and ſpeaking for my ſelfe, thus I proteſt: howſoeuer it be, that I be holden faultie, or ſuſpected, of any indirect courſes and procéedinges in my ſuruey of his Maieſties Collectors, Receyuers, Auditours, or of any kind of wrongfull exaction, extortion oppreſſion, or vniuſt impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of taxes, tributes or tolles on his liege people, or of any kind of miſdemeanour or lawles behauiour towardes his Grace and them: I am able here with an vpright heart to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie my ſelfe and my doinges: albeit, I doe not throughlie know what euerie particular meane officer in his place hath done, eyther good or euill. But for that (as occaſion may require) let euery one of them plead &amp; anſwere for himſelfe, and let the guiltie perſon beare the blame of his owne guiltines,<note place="margin">A fault in the meaner officers</note> as well worthy. And it may be (for it is a thing too too common with officers) that many loue to licke their owne fingers in their offices, howſoeuer they be ſworne to doe and deale iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: whereof the Prouerbe is, that <hi>it is a good thing for a man to haue an office.</hi> Hereof it is (indeed) that many ichinges are purloined, and much of the Kinges treaſure mſcarrieth in
<pb facs="tcp:7975:45"/>
the way: neither can a great part of that either come home to the kinges coffer, or be brought to light, which is either payed or receiued to and for the kinges vſe, ſuch is the fault of Officers. But to ſpeake of my ſelfe, I haue done that which I haue been able to do in mine office, as mine owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience teſtifieth for me be fore God and the king. I haue taken the Accompts, viewed the Audictes, reckoned the Receites, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in the moneis and duties; I haue againe diſburſed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed &amp; paid out y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> I haue or might haue receiued, faithfully to the kinges vſe: that which remaineth is made knowne, and I am alwayes readie both to yeeld an accompt of thoſe things and of my dealinges therein. I haue cleared my fingers, and am ready to cleare my conſcience, I doubt not therefore, but that as the king is wiſe, &amp; hath two eares in his head: ſo he hath not opened them both vnto him which hath ſiniſtrelie accuſed or ſlaundered me before his royall preſence: but hath yet reſerued the one of his eares for me,<note place="margin">Solomons diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> when I ſhall come forth to be heard in my honeſt &amp; iuſt defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, for this princelie vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue hath béen euer apparant and ſhining in the king, from the tyme that he began to go out and in before vs and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

               <p>For mine owne part, I know iuſt warres are not vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full nor vnméete for a godly man to fight in:<note place="margin">The honor of a good Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er &amp; the duety of a Captaine.</note> and the office of a Captaine therein is an honourable calling, and therefore ought to bee vſed and eſteemed accordingly. I haue not béen ignorant what thing this profeſſion is: what is the right end and vſe of the ſame: what is the dutie and office of a Captain: who ought to be choſen for Souldiers, and what they be: what thinges are to be conſidered in them: what thinges are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie: how to place the companies and bandes: what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to giue: what caueats, how to encounter with the enemie: how to fight, how to triumph after victory, &amp; ſuch like. The whole eſtate of a kingdome is contained in two partes, wherof the one is Iudiciall, the other Military: and this Military part is euen a kind of prudence ordained for the common good. There is prudence ſingular, prudence oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomicall, prudence royall, prudence, politicall,<note place="margin">prudence in fiue points.</note> and prudence militarie: By the firſt a man gouerneth himſelfe; by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, he gouerneth his houſhold: by the third a kingdome: by the fourth, a Cittie: by the fift, he defendeth and maintaineth the common good. And here I haue conſidered this ende: that as lawes doe chiefly reſpect the common good: ſo is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare inſtituted for the defence and maintainance of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, either of the kingdome, or Citty. And for this purpoſe I haue conſidered from whence diſturbances haue come to the common peace, which might hinder that good: whether by the ſedition of Cittizens: or by the oppreſſion of innocentes: or by incurſions or inuaſions of forraigne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: and thereupon (by the kinges commaundement and warrant) I haue ſuppreſſed th'one and defended th'other. I haue thereto made choice of méete and able perſons for my ſouldiers, as namely ſtrong, manly, bolde, nimble, well ſet, and of ſufficient yeares: aboue all, I haue regarded ſuch as feare

Furthermore, to euery one I haue cauſed ſuch meete weapons and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be committed, as beſt fitteth their ſtrength, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and conſtitution of body: That now they might know that they ought to bee as Doctors in their facultie. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their apparrell, their dyet, their pay, and their prouiſion in all partes haue alſo (by my carefull proſpection and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) béene duely proportioned and appointed vnto them without deniall, diminution, tasking, telling, wringing, polling, delay or any other inconuenience, which might any way hinder or diſcourage them. And I haue cauſed mine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Captaines to do the like. After this I haue conſidered of the number, of the daily practiſes, of the conſtitution, of the ſtrength, of the induſtrie, of the virilitie of the enemies: I haue alſo conſidered of the armour, the victuals, the places, the times, the aides of either partie. I haue weighed, where ſhould be placed the horſemen, where the footemen: How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhould be vnder the conduct of one Captaine, how many vnder another: I haue cauſed them to haue directions of their wayes in writing, I haue placed in the Campes prudent Counſellors for aduiſe and direction to the Captaines, I haue aduiſed that they conioyne and holde their forces together, &amp; not to be diſperſed, that they keepe their purpoſes ſecret, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from the enemie, I haue willed them to encounter with the enemy in the name and feare of God (as <hi>Gedeon</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and as <hi>Barach</hi> &amp; <hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ioſua,</hi> and as Iepthe and ſuch other noble Captaines haue done) and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in not to feare.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7975:46"/>
be the thinges (my Lordes) which in my dutie (among others) I haue duely regarded to be performed. Beſides this, I haue had a care neither to wrong or oppreſſe any man, nor to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged on any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder colour of mine authority, as my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor <hi>Ioab</hi> hath oftentimes done, to the great affliction of <hi>David</hi> the kinges father, wherewith being much grieued, he could often complaine and lament with teares: as then, when <hi>Ioab</hi> had killed the noble Captaine <hi>Abner, Davids</hi> friend. But ſome peraduenture ſcarcely will belieue this, ſecing they haue neither beene companions of my trauelles in thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, nor been acquainted with my manner of dealing for the king: howbeit I perſwade that the King knoweth all this to be true which I haue ſaid: for he hath beene certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from time to time, not onely by my ſelfe, but by others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout me, which accuſtom not to glorie of the truth of al things: If the King knew it not, nor could bee perſwaded to belieue me, yet I am ſure, that the Lord of heauen knoweth it, &amp; with the ſame mine owne pure conſcience teſtifieth in me and for me. Although I haue beene a Souldier (my Lords) and now a Captaine, and man of warre appointed ouer the Kings hoſtes: yet I praiſe God for this that I haue alwaies feared God, and obſerued a good conſcience, the which whoſoeuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth not nor regardeth, may happily be as ſtrong in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as <hi>Goliah,</hi> but he ſhall neuer preuaile with <hi>David:</hi> hee may peraduenture goe forth with <hi>Gedeon,</hi> but he ſhall be as fit for <hi>Gedeons</hi> warre, as were thoſe doggiſh lappers, and thoſe faint hearted daſtardes, whome hee ſent backe againe. Whatſoeuer ſome ſay, which neyther know the one, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard in their dealinges to expreſſe the other. I know it is a fearefull thing to goe forth to the warres without God, and a miſerable thing to want a good conſcience in the warres. This regarded <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Ioſuah,</hi> &amp; <hi>Othoniel</hi> &amp; <hi>Sampſon</hi> &amp; <hi>Gedeon,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iepthe</hi> &amp; <hi>Dauid,</hi> and therefore haue been noble warriours and happy in battels. And this I would aduiſe all them that goe forth to the wars to reſpect, as they would tender their owne welfare &amp; proſperity in the ſame: But to be briefe, I eſteeme my ſelfe frée from all offence iuſtly offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the kings Grace in this caſe. And now (my Lordes) I
<pb facs="tcp:7975:47"/>
thinke verily,<note place="margin">The cauſe of the k. affliction ſuppoſed not to riſe from any of the Lordes.</note> that wee neede to looke further then into any of our ſelues here aſſembled, if we ſhall find the cauſe of the kings affliction. Neither ought this to be procraſtinated, leſt by our delay the king periſh vnder our hands, and all things grow out of order to the griefe of the kinges friendes and dutifull Subiects, and to the glorie of his Enemies: Nor may wee think, but that though the king haue many friends which are right glad to heare of his proſperitie: yet he is not quite free from ſuch enemies, as enuie and hate both him and his felicity. Theſe be they which can very hardly be perſwaded to thinke or ſpeake well of his maieſtie: but to doe, and to vtter out that which may anie way hurt or blemiſh his roiall honour, they are alwaies readie and waite for their occaſions. Beſides that, wee may with others perſwade, and be thereof grieued in our heartes, that the king being in this time troubled in minde and diſquietted in his ſoule, cannot well vſe the faculty of reaſon, albeit he be ſo wiſe a man: as neither the eye in the head, nor any member in the humaine bodie is wel able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute his proper function, when the ſame ſhalbe moleſted or blemiſhed: And therfore it cannot bee that he ſhall well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne and iudge his people after the diſcretion and wiſdome of a Prince, except that ſpeedie meanes be found and applyed to withſtand this dangerous inconueniences.</p>

Conſcience hath with it a thouſand witneſſes, and as many pleaders to teſtifie for his owners integritie, and to defend the ſame before the throne of Iuſtice. This therefore is the ſwéeteſt and moſt wholſome reſt of mans ſoule, the title of Religion, the ſpirituall Temple, the bleſſed field, the pleaſant gardin, the golden peace, the Angelicall ioy, the holy Arke, the Kings treaſure, the houſe of the ſpirit, and the glaſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a man both ſéeth, ordereth and confirmeth himſelfe to the liuely image of his maker. Though the fleſh oppreſſe vs, the world allure vs, &amp; the Diuel terrifie vs, yet is this treaſure ſafe and ſure within vs from all daunger of euill.

                  <hi>Abiather</hi> was before this time high prieſt, howbeit his cauſe and dealing concerning both God and the king, came into queſtion before the king and his princes, and being found guilty againſt either in his triall, he was worthelie depoſed and the prieſtſhood tranſlated: Then why ſhould I imagin my ſelfe frée from cenſures the rather in reſpect of my place? and why ſhould I not abide the hammering of that which ſhould be obiected againſt me and my ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of procéeding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, the king and his people?

In this ſort, the King hath had and enioyed fiue particular names, and names of honor, two of the which were impoſed by the Lord himſelfe, the third by <hi>Nathan,</hi> the fourth by his Mother, and the laſt hée reſumed by th'approbation of his Lordes.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7975:60"/>
let vs bee contented with that particular example of the two <hi>Women,</hi> which came before the king,<note place="margin">The kinges iudgement in the caſe of the two women. 1.

I hope yee haue not forgotten it: the thing was done within our time, and the matter being ſo rare and worthie memory, could not ſo ſoone be forgotten, although a wonder (as men ſay) laſteth not aboue nine dayes. The King hauing heard the pleading and contention of thoſe two <hi>women</hi> about the childe, at length (as a wiſe Iudge, though yet but a child in yeares) repeated briefly the cauſe: <hi>The one ſaith</hi> (qoud he) <hi>this childe which is alive is my ſonne, and the dead is thine: And the other ſaith, Nay, but thy ſonne is the dead and the living child is mine.</hi> Then ſéeing the caſe doubtfull, &amp; the more, becauſe there were no witneſſes for eyther part, hee ſaid againe to them that ſtoode about him: <hi>Bring me hether a ſword, and they brought it: after that he ſaid againe: Divide the living child into two partes, and give th'one part to the one, and th'other part to the other.</hi> For hee well knew what he would doe, neither was his mind ſo cruell and bloody, as to ſlay the young innocent for the mothers offence: howbeit ſome being preſent, not conſidering his purpoſe, beganne to deride and diſlike this ſentence: But by and by, his intent was diſplaied: for the woman whoſe the liuing child was, fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her vowels to yerne within her vpon her ſonne, whom ſhee thought was ordained for death, cried out and ſayde vnto the king: I beſeech thee my Lord giue her the liuing child, and let it not be ſlaine: but the other woman ſaid: Let the child be neither thine nor mine, but let it be diuided as the king hath ſaid. Then the king gaue the ſentence in iudgement and ſaide vnto the Miniſters that ſtood by: <hi>Geve her the living child</hi> (whoſe bowels yerneth thereon) <hi>and ſlay it not, for doubtles ſhe is the right mother thereof.</hi> This being done, all they of <hi>Iſrael</hi> hearing of this iudgement of the king, feared his Maieſtie, the godly for loue, the wicked for dread: for they ſaw that the wiſedome of God was in him to doe iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. Of this the kinges vertue, ſpake the kings father in the ſpirit; <hi>Thou haſt loved righteouſnes and hated iniquitie.</hi> This being well weighed (my Lordes) I ſee not what ſhould

But we ſee that none of thoſe can this perform, which eyther are themſelues, vnlearned, ignorant, obſtinate, ſelfe willed, prowde, vngodly, or contemne the good counſel and godly and graue aduiſe of the learned, wiſe and vertuous. Surely, wee cannot denie it: for it is moſt apparent, that our Lord the king hath by this his diſcrete iudgement, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed to himſelfe authority, to his kingdome peace and tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie, and to the high God, condigne glorie. Now the better ſorte of all men gratifie his honour, and gladly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelues and their cauſes to his determination, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that hee will do iuſtice: The wicked tranſgreſſors and hypocriticall perſons are fearefull to ſtand before his preſence in the defence of their faults, or triall of their liues. So aſwell of th'one, as of th'other is the king feared, in reſpect of thoſe his vpright and iuſt iuge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, which (as ye ſaid) hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déed appeared ſo admirable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all men.</p>

with frees of all manner of fruit, and fed oxen and beefes, and more cattell and ſheepe then all they which were before him in Ieruſalem. And as for ſiluer and gold: wee know that hee hath made ſuch thinges as plentifull as ſtones in Ieruſalem, and Cedar trees as plentiful as the Mulbury trées that grow in the vaileis: and he hath horſes brought out of Egypt, and fine linnen which his Marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts receiued for a price, &amp; hee hath a chariot which coſt him ſixe hundred péeces of ſiluer, with many of her Chariots and horſemen, yea, an hundred &amp; twelue thouſand horſemen, which hee hath beſtowed in the Chariot Citties, and at Ieruſalem with his Maieſty.

axe, nor any toole of yron heard in the houſe while it was in building. But it would be wonderfull, yea, and beyond mine abilitie to tell and your ſelues preſently to heare, how many ſtrange and diuers and excellent thinges the King prouided and diſpoſed in and about this excellent worke. And in this worke, he ſo well pleaſed the Lord, that he ſpake vnto him ſaying: <hi>Concerning the houſe which thou art in building, if thou wilt walke in mine ordinances, &amp; execute my lawes and keepe all my Commaundementes, to walke in them: then will I make good vnto thee my promiſe which I promiſed to <hi>David</hi> thy father.

                  </hi> Further, after the end of ſeuen yeares (for ſo long was that magnificent houſe in building) the king began to build another houſe for himſelf, about the which he beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed great time, charge and labour, as it is recorded in the book of the kinges Annales: and touching the which the kinges daugther beholding it with admiration, ſaid;<note place="margin">Cant. 3.9.</note>

               <p>Moreouer, I am ſure there hath not been in any age ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens the creation of the world, a captaine ſet ouer the hoaſt of any king, that hath had leſſe trouble and feare then I haue had in my time vnder my Lord the king: for although the king hath many barbed horſes, ſtrong Chariots, valiant men of warre, great ſtore of weapons, armour and munition of proofe, in the which he may compare, yea and be preferred to all the kinges on the earth: yet hath hee in his time had as little vſe thereof, as any whatſoeuer: for the onely terror of the kinges Maieſtie, and the view of thoſe thinges hath ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently daunted the enemie: wherby we and his people haue had little cauſe to complaine of mortall warres, which haue enſuing it ſo many ſlaughters, burninges, famines, plagues, deſtructions and noyſome inconueniences in al ages.

And our owne hiſtories haue largely diſplaied the great infelicitie of our fathers, in the wilderneſſe, and in the time of the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and of <hi>Saul.</hi> But we haue a cauſe to bleſſe and prayſe the Lord our God, who hath in this time of his mercy ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp vnto vs this Prince of Peace. I pray God wee may thankfully eſteeme thereof, and not by our froward ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude offer vnto our God an occaſion of the loſſe of ſo heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a bleſſing, as thoſe commonly accuſtome, which hauing not the feare of the Lord before their eyes, and ſo no ſparkle of the true wiſedome; doe prouoke him to wrath through the lewde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their rebellious heartes. And whether the King (as hee hath the wiſedom of God) foreſeeth in the ſpirit what is liking to beſide vs by his departure from ouer vs: I know not, for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7975:63"/>
what miſery or inconuenience is there, which may not come on them that tranſgreſſe and offend againſt God and the king, if the Lord ſhall eyther commaund or commit the ſpirit of tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to fall on them? * And this may come on vs and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (ſaid <hi>Ahiah)</hi> we know not how ſoone.<note place="margin">Ahiah.</note> But (as ye haue ſaid) the king hath had indéede a glorious peace,<note place="margin">The orders of Sol. houſe.</note> and we haue enioyed the like vnder him: for the which both his Highneſſe and his people may reioyce together.

To be briefe,<note place="margin">His bleſſings</note> wonderfull are the bleſſinges wherewith the almighty hath graced our King: for hee hath beene bleſſed beyound all other kinges on the earth, aſwell with thinges ſpirituall and heauenly, as with thoſe which are temporall and terrene, according to that promiſe in the law made for ſuch as be obedient,<note place="margin">Deut. 28. 2.

ſome, eſpecially they which ſtand to defend the cauſe of <hi>Adoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, Abiather</hi> and <hi>Ioab</hi> with others their confederates againſt the king, imagine that he hath and doth rather vſurp and tyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize, then that he hath lawfully attained and raigned, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in not anſwered to his name <hi>Solomon</hi> which is to ſay <hi>peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> or a <hi>peacemaker:</hi> But howſoeuer it be ſurmiſed or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined by ſuch kind of perſons: it is moſt certaine that the kings entrance with the meanes and manner thereof was both law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; right, and his gouernment therein may be neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned nor iuſtly reproued, but rather iuſtified and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of all wiſe and diſcreet perſons. King <hi>Solomon</hi> (although he had a promiſe of the Soueraignty, both of the Lord, and alſo of his father) he did not preſume to vſurpe on the kingdome as <hi>Abſolon</hi> wold haue done, when aſpiring he lifted vp his hand againſt his owne father <hi>the Lords Annointed</hi>: Nor would hee do as <hi>Adoniah</hi> did,<note place="margin">Sol. was not an vſurper on the kingdome.</note> who was extolled and proclaimed king e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the life time of his father without the conſent, goodwill or knowledge of the king, or of the Quéen. The king our Soueraigne Lord knew better what was meet to be done, bee remembred how his father dealt towards <hi>Saul</hi> the king, namely that albeit hee knew <hi>Saul</hi> to bee reiected of the Lord, and that himſelfe was already annointed to ſuccéede him in the kingdome of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he would dot preuent the time that God had appointed, nor would he lay his hand on him beeing in his place the Lords annointed, although he had many oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities offered him therto, for hee might eaſily haue ſlain him, both in the Caue and in other places without his owne bodily danger. But the king as hee was ordained for the kingdome by the diuine prouidence and the diſcretion of his father: ſo alſo he entred by a lawfull and worthie meane and in the due time. For King <hi>David</hi> knowing well the mind of the Lord, who had promiſed him that there ſhoulde one of his ſeede ſit on his Seate after him, and his name ſhould bee <hi>Solomon,</hi> made a faithfull promiſe vnto Quéene <hi>Bethſeba</hi> the Kinges mother,<note place="margin">1.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7975:65"/>
had heard (by the report of the Kinges Mother and <hi>Nathan</hi>) that <hi>Adoniah</hi> had proudly vſurped, and that this <hi>Solomon</hi> his beloued ſonne and choſon heire apparant was to bee taken for a ſinner in <hi>Adoniah</hi> his ſight, contrary to the Kinges pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made and confirmed by an oath to <hi>Bethſeba</hi> and <hi>Natha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> in that behalfe: <hi>David</hi> was very highly diſpleaſed with <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niah, and ſware againe vnto <hi>Bethſeba</hi> ſaying:</hi>

No doubt the king remembred that worthy example of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſo ful of piety who notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the great iniury his brethren had done him,<note place="margin">Gen. 50.20.</note> did vpon their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and requeſt, forgiue and forget all: yea, he was ſo farre from reuenging that iniury, that he ſaid: <hi>fear not, now will I nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh you, and your children,</hi> and he comforted them, and ſpake kindly vnto them * Thus farre procéeded <hi>Zadoke,</hi>

                  </hi> would alſo confirme if he were preſent, and therein commend and praiſe that noble magnanimity ano rare clemency of the king extended towardes his capitall enemy, at ſuch his entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce into the kingdome, when as beeing not yet ſo perfectly ſetled, &amp; ſcarcely knowing his friendes from his foes, hee might rather haue feared the euent of ſuch a dangerous manumiſſion &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.<note place="margin">Solomon was not willing to revenge an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury.</note> It appeared, that the gratious king was not only glad to pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him which had ſubmitted himſelfe and promiſed obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce but alſo carefull to eſchew all colour or ſuſpicion of tyranny or cruell dealing, euen to an aduerſary. Some Princes and mightie perſons in ſuch caſes are ſeuere perſecutors, euen to the death of them which haue neuer ſo little offended them, although neither they haue nor can poſſibly hurt them, and ſuch (as the king well knoweth) are more hurtfull to their owne territories then the brute creatures are to ſuch as neuer hurt or annoied them.<note place="margin">The Dolphin Fiſh.</note> Wee find of the Sea-Dolphins (of whoſe nature the king hath ſpoken among other beaſtes and Fiſhes) that if perchance they find a dead man in the ſeas they feele by the ſmell of him whether hee hath euer eaten of Dolphin Fiſh, the which if at any time he hath, then they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure him, if not, then they defend him from the biting of all other Fiſhes: and bring him to the ſhoare, as it were to his funeralles in the earth. Lo, although theis Sea-beaſts
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7975:66"/>
doe by nature reuenge any iniurie, yet are they farre off from the perſecuting of him that neuer hurt or annoyed them, howbeit ſuch is mans cruelty and commonly the vſe of mighty perſons, that they perſecute and hurt them grieuouſly of whome they neuer receiued, nor are like to receiue any dammage at all. Wherein they righgtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the wolfe which quarrelled with the Lambe and tooke an occaſion to kill and deuour him, becauſe he drank beneath him in the riuer. But, as I ſaid, albeit it had beene but a iuſt thing in the king to haue reuenged that iniury: yet was hee more mercifull and gentle to his foes to whome in ſteede of death deſerued,<note place="margin">zadoke.</note> hee pardoned and them preſerued * Yee haue well ſaide (quod <hi>Zadoke)</hi> and thus ſhoulde <hi>Adoniah</hi> haue well remembred and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered accordingly and not haue attempted further matter to prouoke the Kings diſpleaſure, and turne mercy into iuſtice againſt his owne life. But ſeeing that hee woulde not continue thankefull vnto his Grace, but renewe his old malice and thereby worke to ſupplant the Lordes An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, I ſee no reaſon why the King ſhoulde further ſpare him to the danger of his own ſafetie. Therefore I veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belieue, that the king hath hath not offended either againſt God or the lawe, in that hee afterward perceiuing the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednes and ambitious practiſes of <hi>Adoniah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Benaiah.</note> did cauſe him to bee rewarded with death. And well worthie (ſaid <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naiah)</hi> for notwithſtanding the King had moſt gratiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pardoned him, and charged him thereon (in my hearing) to bee conteyned within his owne houſe: hee yet preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med too boldely to come foorth, and moſt malepertly to ruſh into the Queenes Chamber after <hi>Davids</hi> death in ſuch ſorte, that ſhee was therewith wonderfully afraide of him, neither coulde ſhee eaſily bee perſwaded that hee beeing her mortal enemy (though now ſubdued) would either wiſh her well or entend her any good. For as enemies are not to bee truſted notwithſtanding their faire faces and wordes: ſo beyond others, had ſhe a great cauſe to doubt of <hi>Adoniah,</hi> who as ſhe wel knew, bare her a deadly hatred, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by her means y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſooner <hi>Solomon</hi> came to the royall Seat, the which he <hi>Adoniah</hi> had
<pb facs="tcp:7975:67"/>
ſo ambitiouſly and eagrelie affected, and vnlawfully vſurped in his fathers life-time. Whereat notwithſtanding that ſhe was as betwene hope and diſpayre when ſhe ſaw him ſodenlie to enter her chamber, ſhe asked him if he came to her in peace, and he anſwered, yea, whatſoeuer he meant, and he ſaid, that he had a certaine petition vnto her, which was, that ſhe would be a meane for him to the king, that he would giue him to wife <hi>Abiſag</hi> the <hi>Sunamite,</hi> (who had beene ſometimes king <hi>Davids</hi> bedfellow to warme and nouriſh him in his weake old age) In the which practice, he had a purpoſe to aſpire to the kingdom: not onely for that, though he were the fourth yet the eldeſt of king <hi>Davids</hi> ſonnes then liuing: but alſo combined with her who was eſtéemed as king <hi>Davids</hi> wife, he might the ſooner in his owne conceite, and by the ſuggeſtion of the kinges enemies, haue obtained the ſoueraigntie. The which deceit and pretence of his, the Quéene as yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued not: and therefore partlie for dread, and partlie for good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will ſhe bare him for king <hi>Davids</hi> ſake, ſhe condiſcended to his deſire, and made requeſt for him vnto the king. But the king being right wiſe, ſoone eſpied this to be a ſuttle deuiſe of <hi>Adoniah</hi> for his owne aduancement;<note place="margin">The nature &amp; manner of the ambitious.</note> hee knew well, that the ambitious are euery way ready to inſinuate themſelues into fauour: before they be preferred they will faine humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, lowlines, honeſtie, affabilitie, and all benignitie, they will follow and obey at a becke, they will flatter and giue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe to all mens doings, fearing to offend any: yea, and (as is the common prouerb) they will bruſh off the duſt from the coate which hath no duſt at all. But being once aduanced &amp; exalted, they begin to change their opinions, and ſoone alter their manners: for now, they are become proud and glorious boaſters: they neuer care to profit, but are glad of preferme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: they thinke themſelues far better then others, becauſe they be placed higher then others: their former friends they diſdaine, &amp; know not their old acquaintances: they contemne their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, and bee vnthankefull to them which haue done them the higheſt good. To let paſſe other things, they be burthenſom to their ſubiects, hateful to al men, headſtrong, troubleſom, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant, gréeuous, and importune. This (I ſay) the king knew wel, and that <hi>Adoniah</hi> was ſwolne with this humour.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7975:67"/>
Moreouer, he perceiued that this matter did doth proceed and was furthered by two others his deadly foes, namely, <hi>Ioab</hi> and <hi>Abiather,</hi> who thereby intended to ſupplant the king, and to ſet vppe <hi>Adoniah.</hi> And therefore when Queene <hi>Bethſabe</hi> requeſted the king for <hi>Adoniah,</hi> (according to her promiſe) he anſwered her: <hi>And why doeſt thou aſke <hi>Abiſag</hi> for <hi>Adoniah</hi>? aſke for him the kingdome alſo: for he is mine elder brother, and hath for him both <hi>Abiather</hi> the the prieſt and Ioab the ſonne of <hi>Zerviah:</hi>
                  </hi> for he knew, that if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doniah</hi> had once gotten <hi>Abiſag,</hi> who was ſo deare and neere vnto his father, he would alſo with her haue ſought for the Crowne. Therefore he ſware and pronounced a ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Adoniah</hi> to recompence his wicked ambition and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie ſaying: <hi>God do ſo to me, and more alſo if <hi>Adoniah</hi> hath not ſpoken this againſt his owne life</hi>! Therefore the king being well aduiſed (for he did euery thing with iudgement) ſent and commanded me to ſmite him that he might die, thereby the ſooner to eſtabliſh the gouerment according to the will &amp; word of the Lord, the which <hi>Adoniah</hi> &amp; his counſailors had practiſed to hinder &amp; ouerthrow. Therfore this actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the king, neither may be reproued, nor may occaſion him (now after ſo many yeares of peace) to be offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with himſelfe therefore.<note place="margin">Abiather.</note> * Thus haue yee ſaide (quod <hi>Abiather)</hi> and your wordes in mine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may not be iuſtlie reproued,<note place="margin">The dealings of Solomon againſt Abia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the prieſt.</note> for yee haue ſpoken nothing but truth.

Thus the brethren of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> hardly handled their poore brother in that they did not onely caſt him into a pit, but ſold him away as a bondſlaue to ſtrangers, following therein the Nature of <hi>Cain,</hi> who murthered <hi>Abel</hi> his brother vpon an offence not giuen,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> but taken.<note place="margin">Iudg. 7.</note> And thus the vnthankfull <hi>Sichemites</hi> (in the time of the Iudges) notwithſtanding that <hi>Gedeon</hi> had beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſhewed no mercy vnto his houſe, but gaue conſent to the ſetting vp of <hi>Abimelech</hi> the tyrant, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the ſame. But thus hath not our King done: Neuertheleſſe, (as reaſon required) he remoued <hi>Abiather</hi> both from his office, and alſo from out of the Court: for hee had diſtained his honour, and diſgraced his function by his lewde behauiour therein, and was an enemie to the kinges eſtate. Therefore that he might not longer abuſe the place, ſo fit for a better perſon, yea, for a perſon perfect, and well approued:<note place="margin">Treacherous perſons are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſuſpected.</note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that he might not thenceforth (as he was an enemie) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily moue or entiſe any of the Kinges Courte to conſpire with him againſt the king and his gouernement, hee was iuſtly depriued of the one, and baniſhed from the other: for as it is indeed wiſedome in time, to caſt out of the congregation, ſuch by whome the ſame is daily offended, and the place abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to auoid the contempt, which by ſuch perſons is often occaſioned: ſo it is good policie timely to obſerue, ſequeſtre and put apart ſuch dangerous perſons from the preſence of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and from the ſocietie of their Lordes and ſeruantes, left they both infect and inflame, and ſo confound the body with

Hence was it, that <hi>Moſes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a ſeparation between the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and <hi>Corah, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> whome the earth opening, ſwallowed vppe in their rebellion.

Therfore wee may perſwade, that this proceeding and iudgement of the king againſt <hi>Abiather,</hi> for the abuſe of his function, and his treacherie againſt both <hi>David</hi> and our Lord the king, (being both lawfull and diſcreetely handled, according to the diuine prouidence, and the equitie of the law) is not the cauſe of the kinges preſent ſorrow.

               <p>* Thirdly <hi>Ioab</hi> expreſſed a moſt ſtubborne nature,<note place="margin">Ioabs ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornes.</note> peruerſe will, and diſobedient heart againſt the Lords Annointed: for when in the kinges name, and by his Highneſſe commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I commaunded him to come forth from the <hi>Altar,</hi> hee neuer ſo much as asked mercy of the king, nor ſought, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated for his owne pardon: but preſuming that the King would not haue aduentured to plucke him from the <hi>Altar,</hi> wherof he had taken hold, although he had been a wilful tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor: he then anſwered moſt ſtoutely in the preſumption of his hart: <hi>I wil not came forth,</hi> and being further certified, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> then the king would not feare nor omit to ſtay him euen there, for his ambitious praetizes and treſpaſſe, he replied (as daring the king and his lawfull authority moſt arrogantly) then <hi>let him ſlay me euen here, for I will not come forth.</hi> Neither think I but he will haue ſome regard to the high reuerence of this place, into the which I haue betaken my ſelfe, for the ſafety of my life, as in the Lords Sanctuary: vpon this aunſwere, the king perceiuing his pride and the ſtubbornes of his hart, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to doe vnto him, euen as he had ſaid, namely to ſtay him euen there, and ſo hee receiued the execution of his iuſt iudgement.

<pb facs="tcp:7975:71"/>
(beyond others his manifold ſlaughters and oppreſſions) hee ſmote and moſt traiterouſly murthered two men which were more righteous and better then himſelfe, in the time of peace, namely, <hi>Abner</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Ner,</hi> captaine of the hoaſt of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2.

Thus truely, when one creature kils another, the heauenlie Powers crie out to the higheſt Maieſty, ſaying: Lord, Lord, this thy ſeruant preſumes to be like thee! Therefore, if the déed be vniuſt, the Creator of all aunſwereth: Suffer him yet which kils, for he alſo ſhall be killed. Vengeance is mine, and I will repay.

<pb facs="tcp:7975:72"/>
the daunger of our king, the euill example of the nobles; and the ſhame of himſelfe. Yee haue well ſpoken (ſaide all the other Princes and Lordes) And indéede, this is not ſtrange, for wee our ſelues haue oftentimes ſeene and wel obſerued, that the vngodly and irreligious perſons, though long forborne and ſuffered to ſinne, yea and to wallow in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, ſaying vnto themſelues, peace, and all is well, yet ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly as holy <hi>Iob</hi> ſaid, they deſcend downe to the hell, neither ſhal their pompe follow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for glutted with proſperitie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterated in malice, hardened in heart, and farre off from true repentance, they euen prouoke the diuine power to powre on them that which they haue iuſtly merited in their abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And truely this is one of thoſe thinges which follow man ordinary courſe, and ſemblable ſucceſſion in the world. But to ſpeake of <hi>Ioab,</hi> we know, that the kinges father ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſpirite of <hi>Iehovah</hi> his God, taught him, how intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable the ſufferance of ſuch a member as <hi>Ioab</hi> was, ſhould bee eſteemed in his wiſedome, which much better were to bee expelled and abandoned of the people, then that hee ſhould bee the occaſion of conſpiracies, and ſeditious in the common State: remembring this (beyond many other his miſchiefes) that hee had embrued his ſword which hung on his loines in the bloud of a friend, as if he had beene his enemie in the open fielde. And now againe, he euen bewraied himſelfe openly, as priuie to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> new conſpiracie of <hi>Adoniah,</hi> who aſpiring y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecond time to the kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſought to obtain to wife <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſag,</hi> K. <hi>Davids</hi> laſt bedfellow: for his conſcience condemning him, he fled fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the kings face, and tooke hold (as ye haue ſaid) of the horns of the Altar: howbeit being a man wiſe &amp; acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the law, he might haue known that a volu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tary mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer or traitor was not to be protected in that place: moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, if he had alleadged, that ſeeing the kings pleaſure was to ſlay him indéed, yet he would die in that holy place, as before the Lord: yet he might know for certaintie, that the place ſhold be nothing profitable vnto him there to die, ſeeing that for his impietie, he was not worthy there to be interred amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whereof all ſuch are worthily depriued, which are execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by an ordinary ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of law, as execrable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7975:72"/>
And in very déed, wherfore ſhold ſuch perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as in their profanitie neither feare God, nor loue his houſe, nor care for his Altar, nor regarde his diuine Seruice, nor ſeeke to honour him in their liues, preſume ſo much on his houſe, on his Altar, on his tabernacle and Sanctuarye as either there to be protected, or there to reſt their wandring bones.

And ſo likewiſe our Lord the King beeing as mercifull as he was wiſe, did not in all the haſt ſet on wicked <hi>Shimei,</hi> to recompence that abuſe he gaue to his father: but, firſt he called him, and remembered him of his vnreuerent behaviour towards the <hi>Lords annointed,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he willed him to build him an houſe in <hi>Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

againſt the peace and gouernment of the king whome hee euer envied, and cloſely aſſaied to reduce the kingdome from the houſe of <hi>David</hi> which the Lord God had choſen, vnto the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of <hi>Saul</hi> whom the Lord had reiected. But behold, whiles <hi>Shemei</hi> went forth in his greedy ambition to finde and fetch home his ſeruants, he loſt and ouerthrew himſelfe! For thus by the diuine preuidence which holdeth them not guiltleſſe, that either touch his annointed, or curſe and maligne their father &amp; mother (howſoeuer the ſeruants of <hi>Shemei</hi> faulted in their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from him, and he had a iuſt pretence to reclaime them) an occaſion was rightly miniſtred in this time of his iudgement, to caſt him as guiltie into the kinges danger, as whereby the king might euen in this (though vpon a freſh occaſion) perform the word of his father <hi>David,</hi> adminiſter true iudgement, and yeeld that deſerued recompence to that rebellious beaſt. Now (my Lords) it is apparant (as ye ſee) that <hi>Shemei,</hi> though a perſon of great place, could neither be iuſtified nor defended in ſuch his impieties: for why (to recapitulate his crimes) he was moſt proud and malitious, a rayler, ſeditious, perfidious, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringer of oath, a lyar and a couetous wretch, for hauing wealth beyond his worthines, he was thereof puffed vp both againſt God and his Soueraign, enuying the regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of <hi>David</hi> and his proſperitie: he curſed the Lords annointed with a moſt horrible curſe, againſt the law and the equitie of the kings cauſe: he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the people to rebellion againſt <hi>David</hi> and his houſe from whome hee aſſaide to tranſlate the Scepter: he was vntruſtie and treacherous to his Lorde, whome with all faithfulneſſe hee ſhoulde haue ſerued in diſcharge of his duetie. Hee had broken his oathe which hee had made to God and the King departing moſt preſumptuouſlye from the Cittie of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> wherein hee had vowed to contain himſelfe. Hee had ſcandalized the Lordes annointed moſt egregiouſlye and more hee regarded his owne priuate lucre and gaine in fetching home his Seruantes which were departed, and drawing thinges vnlawfully to himſelfe, then the kings manifeſt and expreſſe commandement, and therfore in reſpect of th'one, he too boldly tranſgreſſed the other.

him moſt iuſtly the ſentence of death, and withall comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me (the captaine of his gard) to execute the ſame according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereof the king (in my iudgement) or any other his true ſubiects neede not to be ſory or diſpleaſed.

Thus indeed hath K. <hi>Solomon</hi> rightly recompenced his dangerous enemies by the prouidence &amp; help of the power diuine. For doubtles this is the Lords doing, who loueth righteouſnes and hateth iniquity (as the kings father did ſing) therfore as he defendeth the iuſt that feare him in their iuſtice,<note place="margin">Pſal. 45.</note> ſo he ouertaketh the vngodly that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour his high maieſtie in their miſchieuous deuiſes and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them downe.

He aſked wiſedome, &amp; the Lord his God heard him, granted him his requeſt, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his loue &amp; good pleaſure towards him, his actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céedings, by many notable arguments, the which (as we may perſuade with the wife of <hi>Manoah)</hi> he would neuer haue done, had he not loued him, or had he bin willing to haue reprobated him. Thirdly, albeit the <hi>Egyptians</hi> which had forgotten <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> and the manifolde benefites they enioyed by him in his time, had grieuouſly afflicted our fathers (as <hi>Moſes</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded it) yet, as before that time, our Fathers <hi>Abraham, Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and their children haue found refreſhing and comfort from thence, and therefore haue been contented to ſoiourne there, and to ioyne in amitie with them: ſo without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abuſe of our Religion, or danger of our conſciences or iuſt offence to any (being ſtedfaſtly purpoſed to reteine the right honour of <hi>Iehova</hi> our God) we could not ſee,<note place="margin">How farre we may win ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</note> why we ſhould denie this amitie, or to conuerſe with them that are well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, not only to help vs at al needs with the things that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the vſe and comfort of bodyes and life: but alſo to bee reclaymed, and willingly conſent to ſerue the Lorde of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> together with vs, circumciſing the foreſkins of their hearts, as
<pb facs="tcp:7975:77"/>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> exhorteth. And to ſuch a purpoſe aymed our fathers the ſonnes of <hi>Iacob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 34.14.</note> when ſpeaking of the cauſe in queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Sechem</hi> and <hi>Dina</hi> their ſiſter, whom he deſired, they anſwered <hi>Sechem</hi> and <hi>Hamor</hi> his father ſaying: We cannot doe this thing to giue our ſiſter to an vncircumciſed man, for that were a reproofe vnto vs: but in this will we conſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, if ye will be as we are, that euery man childe among you be circumciſed: then will we giue our daughters to you, &amp; we will take your daughters to vs, &amp; will dwel with you and be one people. Neuertheles, to auoyd al occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of iuſt offence, which might be taken of the kings wiues, being brought into the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> becauſe the place was ſanctified, and the Arke of God was repoſed therein: therefore the king built a houſe for this Quéene remote from <hi>Bethlem,</hi> &amp; placed her ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, where ſhe continued. Neither haue we heard any exception made (as yet) to the king for ſuch his matching or conuerſing with her. Therefore I perſwade, that this is not the thing which ſo much offends him now, except perchaunce he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth that ſhe hath a deſire to returne againe into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to looke backe behinde him, as the vnhappy wife of <hi>Lot</hi> did, the which the Lord forbid: or that there is mooued twirt them ſome ſecret emulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ielouſie, or diſlike, wherof I may not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to talke, nor might I, were I able to expreſſe it, the wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the ſhoo being knowne to him only which weareth it.</p>

                  </hi> Wherein, as he verily mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted his right thankefull minde, to ſo bountifull a benefactor, and godly wel-willer: ſo learneth he all children (as by a true Copie) in what honor, reuerence, &amp; eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhould hold thoſe perſons who had beene not onely familiar, but moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and beneficiall vnto their Parents in their liues.

Thirdly,
<pb facs="tcp:7975:78"/>
                  <hi>Hyram</hi> was right beautifull and ſet (as it were) in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Paradiſe,<note place="margin">Ezec. 28.</note> deckt with all manner of pretious ſtones, with Rubies, Tophas, Diamond, Thurkoie, Onyx, Iaſper, Saphyr, Emeralde, Carbuncle and gold: with Tymbrels and Muſicall pipes: he was as an annointed <hi>Cherub</hi> and holy, placed in the ſacred mount of God, and made perfect in his wayes.

Moreouer hee ſent a meſſage to the king, ſaying: <hi>I have conſidered all the things of the which thou haſt ſent vnto me: and I wil ſurely accompliſh all thy deſire therein, &amp;c.</hi> So that both the faith and pietie of king <hi>Hyram</hi> was plainely manifeſted in this kinde of congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7975:78"/>
of <hi>Solomons</hi> graces, eſpecially for that religious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, concerning the ſetting forth of the holy Religion, as whereby not onely we <hi>Iewes</hi> might glorie of this, that wee haue beene earneſt profeſſors of Gods law, and builders of his houſe: But that alſo the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whom wee ſometimes abhorred, are by the diuine fauour inſtigated and perſwaded to conioine with vs in the performance of the ſame, the which alſo, as wee haue ſeene happilie to commence, hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and yet is enioyed to the comfort of vs all. Therefore as for this benefit wee are bound to be thankfull to God and gratefull to that good King: ſo haue wee not found, or may perceiue any iuſt cauſe of offence to ſpring therence, or that the King ſhould thereof be greeued and perplexed in mind, as at this time we obſerue him to bee.

Therefore hath the king preferred a liuing dogge in hope,<note place="margin">Eccles. 9.4.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a dead lyon, in diſpaire. * Then anſwered <hi>Abiather,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede, that thing which ſeparateth the ſoule from the body, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth mans nature and reduceth euery man, of what degree ſoeuer hee bee, into one and the ſame condition, yea, into the ſame confuſed <hi>Chaos</hi> or lumpe from whence hee was taken and formed, is worthily dreaded of all men. But death is the ſame indéede. Therefore may I wel compare him to that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Hiena,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Death is like the beaſt Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</note> which being an enemy to mankind hath a vipers necke, an Elephants back, a mans voice, the quantitie and qualitye of a Wolfe, the haire of an horſe, and in ſexe changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as ſomtimes male, ſometimes female. For Death which is an extream aduerſary to mans life, and ſeeketh how to deſtroy him, ſtaieth not his expectted time and tide, nor waiteth mans leaſure, whether he be prepared or not prepared, but haſteneth and preuenteth it, as doth the viper the naturall time of birth, comming forth by piercing the wombe of his mother, the cauſe of her preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t death. <hi>2.</hi> the Elephant is a beaſt fit for the wars, and Death as a man of warre is oppoſed to al things that hath life in this world and ouercommeth them. <hi>3.</hi> Death is a decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of mortall men: for albeit it is certaine, that all men ſhal dye yet is his hower vncertaine, taking them away when they thinke not of him, and yer they be ready, as the <hi>Hiena</hi> decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth by faining a mans voice. <hi>4.</hi> Death is a conſumer of the liues of all things that liue, as the Wolfe is a deuourer of the ſheepe, without ſacietie. <hi>5.</hi> Death is neither reſtrained nor hindered in his courſe, as the wild horſe being ſtiffe necked wil not be bowed. <hi>6.</hi> Death killeth now men, then women ſparing no ſexe, no age, no degrée of perſons, as the <hi>Hiena</hi> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth kind. Therefore is death worthily dreaded of all men. Howbeit, we cannot yet learne or perceiue that the king hath either ſuch warning: or if he had, would hee be much aſtoniſhed or wofull. For being a man of an excellent ſpirit he feareth not Death, whoſe day (as I haue heard him to ſay) is better in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, then the birth day of a man, and that the dead are more happy then the liuing; and therefore hath thus counſailed the liuing. Be not feareful of death. Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, &amp; them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> come after thee.

the Lord vpon al fleſh: &amp; why wouldſt thou be againſt the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the moſt high? whether it be tenne, and hundred, or a thouſand yeeres, death neuer asketh how long a man hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued?

Which ſentences for th'ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie thereof, are alſo copied out, and notified vnto many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations, which gladly accept and embrace them. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the King hath ſaid, that howſoeuer a man be dead and laid ſenſeles in the graue among the dead, and duſt be returned into duſt: that yet <hi>his Soule,</hi> (which is the beſt part of man) <hi>returneth vnto God that gave it,</hi> that is not to die with the body, but to liue and continue for euer with him whoſe Image it beareth, that fréely exonerated off and from all the miſerable torments and vexations which aſſaile men in this tranſitory life. By the which (as among ſome other his words) we find: as a wiſe man ſhould not be daunted with the terror of death, but rather expect and embrace him: ſo himſelfe is nothing moued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,<note place="margin">Feare not death.</note> being of all men the wiſest. His reaſons therefare ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from the which wee take and gather theſe which follow. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt that <hi>Death is better then life</hi>: or the day of the death happier then the birth day. We may ſimply beleeue him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.<note place="margin">Mors ita. qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis vita.</note> For death is the renewing of a mans nature, I meane to him that leadeth a godly life: for if the life of a man be good, his death cannot be euil. And as men do alwaies deſire that which is good: ſo neither do they feare that which therein they deſire. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, this is that which belongeth to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition of mans nature: for he is borne into the worlde, not to ſtay here, but to dye and to depart againe, therefore, as no man can dye which hath not firſt liued, ſo neither ſhall any liue which ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo dye in this world. Thirdly this is the decree of the almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> vpon all fleſh <hi>once to dye,</hi> to whoſe will and pleaſure therein al men muſt yeeld &amp; obey,<note place="margin">Gen. 3</note> as good ſubiects to their prince in his place and authority. And therefore we ſhould neither murmur at, nor feare that, which he hath ordained, knowing withall, that he decreeth nothing but that which is good and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7975:81"/>
for his children. Fourthly, this is not onely Gods decrée but alſo his good pleaſure by this to glorifie himſelfe, and to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> benefite his children. To whome euen death which came in through ſinne, might notwithſtanding bee a meane to deliuer men from the ſame, when his iuſtice therin ſhalbe ioyned with mercy and louing kindnes. Fifthly, by this meſſenger men are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> ridde and diſcharged of many troubles, vexations, ſorrowes, &amp; miſeries, which oppres and grieue them in this, yea, &amp; through faith in the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> from all ſinne and dangers of Soule, that follow after, and awaite them in this worlde. Sixthly, a man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> may be comforted by th'examples of them that haue paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him and the conſideration of ſuch as follow him. This hath ſeiſed on father, mother, brother, ſiſter, and friend. This hath fallen on <hi>Adam,</hi> on <hi>Abel,</hi> on <hi>Noah,</hi> on <hi>Abraham,</hi> on <hi>Moſes, Ioſuah, Samuel</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and it ſhall not paſſe ouer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> them that come after thée. Seuenthly, this yeeldeth a man reſt from his labours; yea, it yeeldeth the due both to heauen and earth: for hereby the ſoule returneth to God, that gaue it, and the body to the duſt from whence it was taken. This the king conſidereth and feareth not death: but as a man that hath trauailed and now wel neare finiſhed a long and perilous voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is rather glad and ioyfull, then ſory or wofull, when hee ſeeth himſelfe ſo neare the end thereof, and would be vnwilling to begin his voyage againe, eſpecially being weary: ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king being thus farre proceeded, paſſing through the dangerous ſurges of the vanities of this life, he is rather ioyfull, glad, and ready to reſigne ouer his ſoule to his maker, his body to the earth, and his royall dignitie to an other, then any way wofull or fearefull of death, the end of this voyage. Neither is he ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of this (for he hath the higheſt knowledge of all men liuing) that ſo long onely a man ſhoulde deſire to liue in this worlde, as he may bee well able, to glorifie God, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his duty in the ſame (which ſhalbe ſo long,<note place="margin">How long a man ſhould deſire to liue here.</note> as the time of his miniſtry in this life is by the diuine prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce appointed to endure, &amp; no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger) and that when the time of this his ſeruice is determined, he ſhould then deſire rather to depart he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to liue any longer, aſſuring himſelfe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee ſhall neither effect nor
<pb facs="tcp:7975:82"/>
performe any thing out of the due time (for euery thing and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery worke hath his opportunity and time, as the King hath ſaid) This time therefore abſerued <hi>Noah, Abraham, Iſaack Iacob, Ioſeph, Moſes, Ioſuah, Samuel, David</hi> and other our godly forefathers in their liues. And this time (I am aſſured) the King ſhall accompliſh, and therein ſhall doe and performe that onely, which the Lord hath appointed him in his place, for his glory and the benefit of his people. Thus farre the Princes were contented to heare one another of them, and withall to iuſtifie that which had beene ſaide for the King. Howbeit, howſoeuer ſome of them diſſembled the matter, there was not yet any one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that either declared or reuealed the cauſe of the Kinges affliction. Neither (indeede) was hee which knew the matter, willing to open it, becauſe it touched the Kings Maieſtie. Whereby it was like to bee as daungerous to his perſon and ſtate, as the malady is to that pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent the cauſe of whoſe griefe is neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed nor wel known to the phiſician. This the lords co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered: therfore they yet deſiſted not to ſearch &amp; enquire further vntil they found out the cauſes of the kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſickneſſe.</p>

At this worde,<note place="margin">The princes.</note> the Princes and Lordes were fully aſtoniſhed all abaſhed, and not able to ſpeake for anguiſh of mind, ſtoode looking one on another. Notwithſtanding, after a whiles they deſired reuerend <hi>Zadok</hi> to explane that, which he had (as yet) but briefly and obſcurely touched: and firſt how it could be, that the kings ſorrow might riſe from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conſideration of his moſt excellent Supremacie, and the high glory of the kingdome of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> wherof both the king and they all with his people had ſo good an occaſion to be glad and to reioice with praiſes to the Lord God?<note place="margin">zadoke. The great glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry of Solomon and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was a pronoſtication of a future de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clination.</note> To this replied <hi>Zadoke.</hi> Although that men for the moſt part neither foreſee, nor foreſhew their owne dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers imminent, like as the Sun, the Moone, the ſtarres, the ſeas, the trees, the hearbes, the beaſtes, the birdes, the wormes the Fiſhes, the elementes naturally pretend and foreſhew the times, the tides, the tempeſts, &amp; the alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of terrene bodies: yet who doubteth of this, that the king being wiſe and prudent foreknoweth things yet to come, not onely as ſuch as haue a propheticall ſpirit, but as thoſe which are able and accuſtomed to gather the effects and euents by the cauſes and occaſions in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7975:83"/>
naturall things which is not the meaneſt king of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> but a ſcience right excellent, no leſſe profitable for many pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes in mans life, and that which appertaineth to a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature. By this he ſeeth that thoſe thinges which floriſh moſt beautifully, often wither moſt ſpeedily, when yet others endure. This is firſt found in the life and conſtitution of mans body, wherein that which is moſt floriſhing and glorious, is ſooneſt and that lightly altered and turned al about, as health into ſickenes, ſtrength into weakenes, beautie into deformitie, proſperity into miſery, life into death. And hereof the cunning phiſicia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s pronoſticate the future ſickenes and danger of that per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon, whom they ſee to ſtand in the higheſt grade of proſperity and health: as when the Sea is at the very higheſt, then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth ſodainly to fall againe by the Ebbe: when the Moone is at the fulleſt by and by ſhe waneth. Therefore the wiſe ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter, knowing how ſtormes and tempeſts ſuccéede calmes and tranquillities, hee fearing thereof prepareth himſelfe to eſchew the danger. Now the king knowing all this, and ſeeing himſelfe placed in the higheſt grade of his honour, and that the kingdome of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is no leſſe aduanced to the higheſt grade of worldly felicitie, therein farre preferred before all the kings and kingdomes of the earth: he alſo knoweth, that now of neceſſity muſt enſew and follow an alteration, yea, a declination of that reſplendent glory: and that the ſooner by the meanes of mans inconſtancy, wherein he is like a bird in a Cage which will not bee quiet, though by his exceſſiue flittering and ſtriuing he kill himſelfe.</p>

Moreouer he called them the land <hi>Cabul,</hi> which is barraine, or as old and worne out: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit we perceiue not, but that he might be well enough pleaſed with thoſe Citties, foraſmuch as the king hath not onely in loue, ioyned amitie with him as his brother; when he could haue made him a Subject vnto his power by conqueſt: but alſo hath admitted him into his Territories, ſo farre as hee thought it was lawfull for him to doe, for the land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> being deuided and appointed by lot to them after their Tribes, might not be alienated nor giuen away to ſtrangers.

Ye haue therefore well done (moſt noble <hi>Zadoke)</hi> to put vs in mind of this thing. Thus haue wee heard of two cauſes of the kings troubled minde declared and committed to due conſideration. Now let vs likewiſe vnderſtand the third cauſe, which riſeth (as ye ſaid before) of the Queene of <hi>Arabia.</hi> It ſeemeth very ſtrange vnto vs, that from thence the king ſhould take any conceit of ſorrow, when (as we know) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued her ſo ioyfully, entertained her magnificently, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed her with Maieſtie.<note place="margin">zadoke decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the third cauſe of the kings trouble.</note> But that notwithſtanding, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported (ſaid <hi>Zadoke)</hi> that ſithence the time that noble Quéene departed from the Court, ſhee addreſſed certaine letters vnto the king, whereby he is certified, that whiles ſhee was here with the king, ſhe eſpied and beheld in the kinges houſe (called the houſe of the forreſt or of the wood, which the king hath buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for his pleaſure) a tree, on the which (as ſhe hath learned by a diuine inſpiration) a certaine man ſhall be put to death: For whoſe death, the Iewiſh kingdome ſhalbe vtterly deſtroyed &amp; waſted. And this hath that noble Queene in thoſe her letters by many tokens and arguments made knowen to our Lord K. <hi>Solomon,</hi> as a thing requiſite to be declared (and if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) to be preuented in time: the which neuertheleſſe at her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here, ſhe durſt not to reueale: partly for feare of the kinges diſpleaſure: * for Kinges are ſoone exaſperated towardes them which in any thing ſeeme to diſlike them &amp; their works, which is the cauſe that oftentimes they are praiſed and iuſtified, when rather they deſerue to be blamed, whereby they flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their owne ſinnes and foreſee not the vnhappy euent of their peruerſe ſtudies and endeuors. Neither therefore do they ſometimes heare, know, or ſee (and ſo not enioy and vſe) that which might tend to their ſafetie and beſt profit, albeit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing be commonly knowen and talked of abrod: partly ſhe concealed it in that ſhe was very loath, in that time of her princely enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, to offer vnto him any occaſion of ſorrow or heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7975:87"/>
* for they that are inuited or wel entreated, are or ſhold be vnwilling to vtter or ſhew forth that (eſpecially to their friendes when they be merry) the which they thinke will trouble their mindes. But now vpon theſe tidinges by certificate from the Quéene, the king is ſtroken with a meruailous feare, thinking that this prophecie of the Quéene ſhould aime to the holy <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> or ſome other excellent perſonage, whome our nation ſhall vniuſtly oppreſſe and put to death on this Trée. And it is that (as I heare) which <hi>Seth</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Adam</hi> did ſometimes plante on his fathers Sepulchre, and hath euer floriſhed as a tree of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> til time it pleaſed the King to take it into the houſe of the forreſt * Surely, the king had this tree in no mean eſtimation and price,<note place="margin">It is ſaid that about the time of Chriſt this tree was growen againe whereof there was taken to make the Croſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</note> els had it not been placed in this glorious houſe. But now, the king vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe tidings, and willing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this inconuenience feared to enſew, hath remoued it from thence and hid it full deepe vnder the earth, that it might hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth neither ſproute againe, nor be found of any man liuing. And it may be, that the king (the rather by this occaſion (fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing the ruin of our Nation (according to Gods euerlaſting decree and purpoſe) is very ſorowfull and heauy: but the more becauſe this deſtruction ſhalbe iuſtly procured and caſt on them for their iniury, cruelty and enuy againſt him whome they ſhould in all duty loue, honour and embrace.

               <p>And now albeit the king knoweth that no man liuing can withſtand the purpoſe of God in this matter: yet he would not that any thing ſhould either be placed in his houſe, or preſerued and kept within his realme, which might miniſter the meanes of this vnhappy euent in time to come: for albeit men are not to enter into the depth of Gods ſecret deuiſes: yet, looking on

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. Therefore the theefe, or the murtherer may not ſay when ſuch a fact is done. <hi>It was Gods will, it ſhould be ſo done, els it could not be done: therefore I may be diſcharged or excuſed</hi>!

Now truly (ſaide <hi>Adoniram)</hi> this being conſidered of, is no ſmall cauſe of a troubled heart. For ſuch a conceit therof being caſt into a mans minde, and eſpecially into the kings minde, cannot but occaſion great conflicts, and the rather, for that in the very place which he had erected and ſo beautifully garniſhed for his pleaſure and delight there ſhould be found ſuch a miſchiefe, as might either diſgrace or ſhadow all.

(I ſay) the king is for this right wofull and ſad, as nature and pietie requireth: yet I ſay not that he is ouercome therewith, knowing well (as he is a wiſe man) how to bridle affections, and therein beſt to behaue himſelfe: yet as a mortall man. * But (my Lords) beſides this naturall ſympathie and pietie, ſuch was the wiſedom, the iudgement, the grace &amp; vertues of his <hi>Mother,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bethſabe a wiſe woman, right profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the king in her life.</note> and ſuch a helpe and comfort ſhe was vnto him euery way, that as he thought in her life he could not honour her enough: ſo he may not forget her and her vertues after her death. As this noble gentle woman inſtructed and taught the king when he was a child: ſo ſhe neuer deſiſted to aduiſe and counſaile him in all godlines being a man: and ſhe thought it appertained to her dutie, not only to teach and catheciſe him with wiſedom: but alſo both to admoniſh him gently, and to reprooue him ſharpely: knowing well that ſometimes gentle admonitions, and ſometimes ſharpe chidings hath their place to doe good in them that feare God, as ſome precious ſtones ſhine the better bring ſteeped in ſharpe vinegar, &amp; ſome others, when they bee boyled in ſoft oyle. There be ſome, which though they be in place,<note place="margin">The neceſsitie of good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions.</note> either dare not, or liſt not to tell, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh or reprooue the mighty and rich vntill they ſée them through folly fall downe to the ground, and Fortune ſternely frowne at them: then perchance, (but neuer before) they wil tel them of that which now it is too late for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to auoyd: reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling therin that maladie, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then &amp; neuer before appeareth, when it hath throughly conquered nature in a man. And then they will ſay, as the Phyſician did to the man which after his long cure dyed, <hi>ſurely if thou haddeſt forborne to eate of this, and that kind of meat, thou mighteſt have lived longer.</hi> But hereof it commeth that as thoſe which are wounded, when they want friends are conſtrained to ſeeke helpe of their enemies: ſo euen thoſe noble perſonages themſelues being offenders in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (as they bee men and doe offend often) hauing none of ſuch their faithfull friends about them, as will either admoniſh or gently reprooue them of their offences, doe often heare of their faults afterward by their very enemies, and that to their ſhame and ſorrowe. Truely, the king knowing both the wiſedome and faithfulneſſe of his <hi>Mother,</hi> and conſidering
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7975:90"/>
what a comfort and ſtay ſhee was vnto him, not onely in thoſe priuate things: but alſo in the better adminiſtration of the kingdome with him: hee did worthily honour her, hee was glad to heare her, hee diſdained not to follow her wiſe directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; placed her on a ſeat next vnto his royall maieſtie, when at any time hee ſate to giue ſentence of iudgement in matters of the higheſt importance. But now this princely counſailor is taken away: and the king ſeeth that the departure of ſuch a pretious ornament of his pallace, is a prognoſtication of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them that remaine behinde her: ſeeing that with the loſſe of ſuch a member, the common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of much wiſedome and many good things. And in this reſpect,<note place="margin">The departure of Nathan, The loſſe of good counſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors a prono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtication of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture troubles.</note> the death and departure of that excellent Prophet <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> his Scholemaſter and faithfull counſailor, doth not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle grieue him at this time: not only in that <hi>Nathan</hi> is dead: but alſo in that the king by his departure is depriued of a moſt wiſe, godly &amp; happy counſailor. For truly this is one chief cauſe that a Prince ſhould mourne, namely, when his graue Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours and prudent Counſailors be taken from him: for this is as if the eyes ſhoulde bee pulled from out of the head, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhould faile in him that hath an office of waight to bee performed, the ſtayes taken from an houſe, and a ſtaffe from him that leaneth thereto. In this conſideration, our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the wilderneſſe lamented with aboundance of teares, when <hi>Moſes</hi> their Leader was taken from them, and in this reſpect all <hi>Iſrael</hi> mourned mightily ouer <hi>Samuel,</hi> the Lords Prophet, when he dyed. For theſe did ſee, that in the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away of thoſe worthy Perſonages, a great part of their glorie, their weale, their proſperitie, their ſafetie and defence departed alſo with them: for the taking away of moſt noble Kings, worthy Princes, graue Senatours, godly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and vertuous perſons,<note place="margin">

So long as <hi>Noah</hi> was yet remaining in the world without

the Arke, the Lorde ſtayed the waters that they ſhould not fall to couer the earth: but when <hi>Noah</hi> was embarked then by and by the deſtruction threatned, was executed on them that remayned without the Arke.

But after that hee reiected <hi>Samuel,</hi> (but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally after the death of <hi>Samuel) Saul</hi> was ſo agonized for want of good counſaile, that deſpayring of good ſucceſſe hee ſlewe himſelfe, diſgraced his houſe, and the people were ſorely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. Euen ſo while thoſe two right noble and godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, namely <hi>Bethſabe</hi> the Queene, and <hi>Nathan</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet liued and proſpered in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> all things went well, and the King and his people proſpered in great honour and peace: but (ſurely) ſithence the departure of thoſe two worthy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, there is a kind of defect eſpied in many things, yea aſwel in the king, as in his people, as yee ſhall more plainely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, when I ſhall rippe vp vnto you the ſeauenth cauſe of the kings ſorowe. Worthily therefore may the king bee greiued for the loſſe of his moſt princely mother, &amp; no leſſe for the death of the diuine Prophet, and wiſe Counſailor <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> as for the falling downe of two ſuch principall pillars, as by whoſe ſtrength and counſaile both the king and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> hath beene (ſithence the kings moſt hapy gouerment) the better ſtayd vp and maintained in peace and proſperitie.</p>

                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:7975:91"/>And in very deede (ſaid the Princes) this may be no ſmall grief to the King (in our iudgement) as now wee call to minde and conſider how tenderly his mother loued him,<note place="margin">The princes aſſent to za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dokes reede.</note> and how honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the Prophet eſteemed him: againe how deere was th'one, and how fauoured was th'other of his royal grace, wee cannot but teſtifie.

Neither may we imagine, that any light cauſe ſhall moue a father to caſt on his owne children a curſe in ſteed of a bleſſing.

To this anſwered the Princes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: Verily, verily, theſe be cauſes and argumentes waightie and ſufficient to prouoke ſorrow and griefe, and ſuch as may trouble any King, Prince or Potentate in the world.

                  </note> namely <hi>Rezon</hi> was the ſonne of <hi>Eliada,</hi> who fled ſometimes from his Lord <hi>Hadadezer</hi> king of <hi>Zoba,</hi> when <hi>David</hi> ſmote him as he went to enlarge his border at the riuer <hi>Euphrates,</hi> who alſo gathered men vnto him, and became captain ouer the company when <hi>David</hi> ſlew them, and they went to <hi>Damaſcus</hi> the Metropolitan cittie of <hi>Syria</hi> and dwelt there, where he alſo raigned king. Therefore is hee an aduerſary to <hi>Iſrael</hi> retaining his minde of reuenge and denying to pay tribute.

But ſuch is the pride, inſolency, ambition, and ingratitude of many, whom the fauour and benignitie of good Princes hath vnworthily exalted and honoured, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting both themſelues, their places &amp; al the goodnes of their gratious princes and their duties, do eagerly ſeeke to attaine to the very places and honours of their Princes and benefactors, by wicked and vngodly meanes.

If hee touch the high mountaines they ſhall tremble and ſmoke (as <hi>David</hi> did ſing) And this to confirme, the king hath placed before his eyes the fearefull Iudgements of God, which in his wrath were executed on the old rebellious people: he remembreth that when the Lord God was prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to anger, by the diſobedience of our firſt parents <hi>Adam,</hi>

All men be ſinners and offend in many things: therefore what they doe, we may not reſpect, nor preſume to follow: but regard what the Lorde hath inſtituted and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. And ſurely this pluralitie of wiues, hath beene a fault euen in thoſe fathers,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15. &amp; 16.3.</note> howſoeuer they aymed thereby to the multiplying of their ſéede, whereof they hoped the <hi>Meſsiah</hi> ſhould be borne, according to the promiſe. Neither ſhould they haue ſtaggered in faith touching the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> to imagine that Gods promiſe could not haue beene performed without their owne wiſedome and meanes. <hi>Abraham</hi> ſeeing his wife aged, thought that the promiſe of God ſhould haue holden on the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

of <hi>Hagar:</hi> howbeit, God being faithfull effected his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in <hi>Sarah,</hi> though beyond the courſe of nature, and mans expectation. And this to prooue, we reade that at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when God created man, he made them Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, and therein, not three, or foure, or more; but only two in one fleſh, namely, one man, and one woman.<note place="margin">Gen. 2.24.</note> And there-vpon this Law was ordained, that <hi>for this cauſe a man ſhould leave his father and mother, and ſhould cleave to his wife,</hi> not Wiues.

From whom it was drawen to others, &amp; continued for a cuſtome in the poſteritie, though ſo contrary to the Law and ordinance of the Lord. But leauing the errors of thoſe, we are to obſerue that firſt ordinance, with thoſe holy fathers of that firſt Age, if we will be free from blame in that reſpect, and not preſume the tranſgreſſion thereof, howſoeuer ſome others, bee they kings or potentates of the earth haue followed, or faulted, and beene tollerated in the abuſe of the ſame.

                  <hi>Let thy wel be bleſſed, and be glad with the wife of thy youth: let her be as the louing Hynde, and pleaſant Roe, let her breasts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſatiſfie thee, and hold thee ever content with her love.</hi> Hee ſpeaketh of a wife, not wiues: neuertheles, howſoeuer it hath beene occaſioned, the king hath offended, yea, he hath wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully exceeded therein: for he hath not contented his luſt with one wife, according to the Law, nor with a fewe wiues, after the example of thoſe godly Fathers, <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iacob:</hi> but he hath taken vnto himſelf <hi>700.</hi> wiues which were Quéens, &amp; <hi>300.</hi> Concubines, in the whole a <hi>1000.</hi> as the like was neuer heard off before this time. And by theſe women hee hath béene drawen into an inordinate luſt, and bin ouercome in affection to the ſtayning of his honor &amp; blemiſhing of his holy profeſſion, the which is in him an heynous fault. For although the heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (which know not God, and are as brute beaſtes without vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding) doe neigh as the ſtoned horſes after euery wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that hath a faire face, and ſéeke to ſatiſfie their fleſhly luſts in theſe kinds of pleaſure: yet ſhould not king <hi>Solomon,</hi> endowed with ſo excellent a ſpirit and wiſedome, haue ſought to ſatiſfie his deſire therein: and that the rather, becauſe as the conſtancie of the chaſte helpeth to the prolonging of life,<note place="margin">The inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of fleſhly luſt.</note> as appeareth in the Vultures, which being chaſte and ſober that way, liue (as it is ſaid) by nature an hundred yeeres: ſo they which delight in fleſhly luſt, and be ſo ordinarily inflamed and ouercome with the ſame, are of a very ſhort life, as wée may ſee in thoſe Sparrowes, which of other birdes are full of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie. And it is a ſure axiome, that they which engender much, liue the leſſe while. The king therefore in this hath abreuia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, empared, wounded and endangered his life. His naturall life is ſhortened, his ciuill life is diſtained, his ſpirituall life is perced, and his life eternall is endangered. For in the firſt, there is an euacuation of that naturall heate and moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by the which mans life is conſerued, and the ſtrength of body ſuſtained. Yea, Luxurie is ſuch an immoderate wantonneſſe of the fleſh, which as a ſweete poiſon, an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate plague and a pernitious potion, doth both weaken mans naturall body, and effeminateth his minde. O ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tréeme
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7975:101"/>
filthineſſe of luſt! all other ſinnes are without the body, but hee that giueth himſelfe ouer to this ſin, offendeth againſt his owne body! Before this goeth euer heate and petulancy, with it in company is ſtinch and vncleanneſſe, and after it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth ſorrowe and repentance. Theſe bee the leaders, the fellowes, and the followers of luxurious perſons. Secondly, this ſinne taketh from a man all his credite, good name and glory: and bringeth to him diſtruſt, an euill fame, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. What vice is more diſhoneſt? what more damnable? what more hurtfull to mans ciuill life and eſtimation? for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, how vertues are decayed: how victories languiſh: how glory is ſwallowed vp of infamie: how the vertues of minde and body are infringed? Surely a man can ſcarcely diſcerne, whether it be better or worſe, to be captiued either of this vice, or of his mortall foes. * Thirdly, the ſpirituall life, is in them wounded: for all ſuch as giue themſelues ouer to the luſt of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, doe grieue the ſpirite of God in themſelues, and ſuppreſſe all the good motions of mind, whereby being like to the beaſts, they runne into many miſchiefes, and ſinne more and more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God and their owne ſoules.<note place="margin">Gen. 6.5.</note> Thus thoſe olde ſinners were alienated from the Lord: for as their thoughts were by nature euill, they were the ſooner by this furthered and blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in their malice: for why the ſpirit of God which ſanctifieth and garniſheth men with graces, did not onely depart from them, but alſo repented that euer they were, in reſpect of their filthy abhominations. Neither is it poſſible, that hee can liue ſpiritually to God, which is dedicated to the fleſh: for between the ſpirit and the fleſh there is euer contrarietie. Laſtly, as this withſtandeth the graces of the diuine ſpirit heere, by the which men ſhould paſſe to the life of glory, as by vertues men attaine to honor: ſo indeede it ſhutteth vp vnto them the gate of the kingdom of God, into the which, neither fornicators,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.24.</note> nor leachers, nor vncleane perſons ſhalenter, no more then <hi>Adam</hi> could enter <hi>Paradize,</hi> after that he had polluted himſelf with ſin. Lo, what an enemy is the luxurious man to his owne life, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther natural, political, ſpirituall, or eternall. And by this we ſee the dangerous condition of our L.K. <hi>Solomon!</hi> yea, by this we may behold &amp; conſider what is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fraile nature of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this life.
<pb facs="tcp:7975:102"/>
A man being in honor and puffed vp in proſperitie, hath none vnderſtanding (as king <hi>David</hi> ſayde) and therefore may bee compared to the beaſts which periſh: for he forgetteth himſelf, he remembreth not the Lord, hee waxeth proude, inſolent, hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, high minded, prone to pleaſures, and ingratefull to God. In this hee well reſembleth the <hi>Siphny</hi> ſtone which though of it owne nature ſoft, yet boyled in oyle, waxeth wonderfull hard. But after this, their follow on him an hell of miſchiefes &amp; huge torments: for who can proſper in his deuiſes or endeuors, which forgetting God, walketh his owne wayes in the lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of carnall luſt?<note place="margin">Gen. 19.

Sam. 11.</note> After that God had both aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him and giuen him reſt and proſperitie in his honor, hee too ſoone forgate himſelfe, and burned in luſt, in whome the loue of the fleſh was ſo naturall to the fleſh, that albeit reaſon, as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, would put the deſire to flight in him, yet the fleſh yéelded herſelfe a captiue thrall to thoſe deſires, by the which he was more fiercely aſſaulted, then with the greateſt enemies that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he had. For there be no foes ſo deadly and importunate, as thoſe which a man findeth and foſtereth againſt himſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelfe:<note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.14.</note> 
                  <hi>David</hi> had fought with the huge <hi>Goliah,</hi> and caſt him to the ground: hee had killed a Lyon and a Beare, which came to deuour his ſhéepe: he vexed and ſpoyled the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines</hi> and other the enemies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and euer returned home a victor and triumpher in the name of his God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they could ſing to his praiſe, <hi>David hath ſlayne his tenne thouſand</hi>! Howbeit this noble Prince, in his reſt and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, (as I ſaid) ſuffered luſt in him to ſubdue reaſon, gaue the raynes at large to carnall appetite, and therein inflamed and agonized, he vnlawfully deſired &amp; abuſed <hi>Vriahs</hi> wife: and yet not ſo contented, he cauſed <hi>Vriah</hi> to bee vniuſtly murthered; whereby he diſtained his honor, he quenched out the ſpirituall graces, and endangered his ſoule, to the high diſpleaſure of God, who doth neither loue, nor permit ſuch delights in the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7975:102"/>
children of men, much leſſe in his owne the ſeruants of grace. And thus (be it here ſpoken in counſayle) hath our Lorde the king forgotten himſelfe, and both abuſed and diſhonoured his honor. Thus men ſet in honour are ſoone ouertaken therein: for temporall felicitie is a moſt vnquiet thing, neither can mans nature bee contained whithin his bounds and dutie of life in worldly proſperitie. Worthily therefore <hi>David</hi> thanked the Lord, for that he had beaten him with aduerſitie, which (as he confeſſed) hee found to be beſt for him. <hi>It is good for mee</hi> (ſayd he) <hi>that I have beene troubled.</hi> But if wiſe men and godly men can ſcarcely and very ſeldome meaſure themſelues in the vſe of this flattring enemie: how then ſhould the ignorant and ſinners doe, when the Lorde ſulleth them in this eaſie cradle?</p>
               <p>Beſides this, here wee ſee,<note place="margin">What man is, when he is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ouer to his owne will.</note> how fooliſhly the wiſeſt of all men behaueth and demeaneth himſelfe, and into what incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences he runneth, when it pleaſeth God for his tryall, to looſe vnto him the raines of youthfull libertie, and to commit him to the guide of his owne counſailes! Surely, hee may well be compared to the pondrous yron, that of it owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſinketh to the bottome of the ſtreame, except it bee ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained or holden vp by ſome other thing. This ſhould mooue vs to pray vnto God, that as hee would vouchſafe to ſuccour and defend vs: ſo he would not giue vs to our owne willes: but that his will might be fulfilled in vs. For if we ſhould but haue the guide of our ſelues, and not be ſuſteined and defended by the power and will of God, it cannot bee otherwiſe, but that we ſhall not only fall, but fall away and periſh from him, and from our owne ſaluation euery houre, in euery day of this our life. Therefore, that I may be briefe, howſoeuer this euill cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the pluralitie of Wiues came in, or howſeuer this kinde of pleaſure hath beene vſed, and delighted in, among worldly men: yea, howſoeuer many wiſe men, haue beene ſéene to ſolace themſelues therein, it is doubtleſſe in the king a great fault: and the more, becauſe hee is the king and ſhould be a guide of holineſſe, and good example of life vnto others: eſpecially, becauſe the Lorde hath ſo bleſſed him with wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and diuine graces before all the kings of the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7975:103"/>Thus haue I explained the firſt of thoſe thrée faultes, which prouoked the Lord to diſpleaſure, the conſideration whereof, now moueth the king to this heauines of minde.

Theſe words being ſpoken, and in ſuch ſort as <hi>Zadok</hi> could deliuer them, prouoked the Princes to wéep with him wéeping, &amp; to condole together the kings hard lot.

Yea, is hee not ſtronger and more wiſe, and politicke then any of them all? And doe they not more dread and admire him, then hee hath neede to doubt, what they are able to doe againſt his Maieſtie? But alas, luſt is blinde, and many wiſe men (as I ſaid before) bee led blindfolded into the pitte of preua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rication and woe, by ſuch women, as being of an euill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and like Religion, will receiue no kinde of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile which withſtandeth or hindereth their fonde luſtes and vanities. And thereof it is, that the King ſo prudent, wiſe and famous, hath beene bewitched, enchaunted, and beſotted ſo farre; that in the lightneſſe of voluptuouſneſſe, he hath altered his ſingle minde, and diſtained his honour.

*Theſe be great faults (my Lords) but yet hee is much more blameable and guiltie of iudgement, &amp; no leſſe of puniſhment,<note place="margin">The third ſin of Solomon.</note> (though hee bee a king) becauſe that in his luſtes <hi>hee hath turned away his heart from the Lorde his God, which hath appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him at two ſundry times.</hi>

Howbeit, I will not take away all the kingdome, but will giue one <hi>Tribe</hi> to thy Sonne, becauſe of <hi>David</hi> my Seruant and becauſe of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which I haue choſen.

                  <hi>I will worſhip them</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that worſhip me: but they which deſpiſe me ſhall come to ſhame.</hi> Moreouer I remember what the King himſelfe hath ſaid in his wiſe Prouerbs. <hi>The turning away of the vnwiſe ſhall haſten his owne destruction.</hi> And well I wot therefore that of all the creatures in the world,<note place="margin">pro. 1.32.</note> the impious and wicked perſon is moſt vnhappy, that not only in reſpect of his ſinnes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of life, but in regard of his end and concluſion, for as the end of much eating is ſicknes, the end of pleaſure is paine, the end of this life is death and corruption: ſo the end of the Sinner is extreame anguiſh and miſerie both in this worlde and after his death. For being iuſtly ſequeſtred from the ſocietie of the Saintes, and ſo ſhut out from the diuine protection, he is, euen whiles he liueth, moleſted with an vnquiet conſcience, an aking heart feareful cogitations and dreames and many afflictions both of body and mind, the hand of God being ſtreatched foorth againſt him from aboue, and the inſtrumentes of wrath tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting him from beneath: Finally, this life finiſhed, hee broyles and toyles in bitter tormentes for euer more: In the which he may be compared to thoſe flying fiſhes which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the waters are perſecuted by other fiſhes for their pray, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:7975:107"/>
ſpringing vp with their finnes into the aire, they are followed and deuoured of the cormorants and Sea-meawes: or to that bird which being on the ground is hunted by dogs, and flying aboue the earth is taken by the vultures: for true it is that the man of impietie and ſinne hath neither peace nor ſafety either in this world, or in the world to come. This thing the kings fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther well knew, and conſidered of in the depth of his heart: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he was remembred of his tranſgreſſions and faults by <hi>Nathan</hi> and by <hi>Gad</hi> the Lordes prophets and meſſengers to him in that reſpect, feeling the true ſenſe of Gods angry cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance iuſtly bent againſt him and his people for the ſame, &amp; the perilous eſtate both of himſelfe and his dominions, by and by (although a choſen, magnanimious, puiſſant and valorous minded King) comming to anſwere before the higheſt God, hee ſodainly caſt himſelfe downe to the earth, as a baſe caitiffe, hee repented him of his ſinnes, and in the fearefull agony of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted ſoule, he cried out <hi>I have ſinned! I haue ſinned: Mercy Lord mercye</hi>! nor would be leaue off crying, and repenting, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe eſtéeme of himſelfe then a ſinfull, guilty and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned wretch, vntill he perceiued that the Lord was willing to be appeazed and of his mercie, to turne his gratious face towards him as in times paſt: reſembling the bird of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> which beeing taken in a ſnare is neuer quiet, nor leaueth crying and flittering till time he either dye or be deliuered. And thus beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it our Lord the King, to eſteeme of himſelfe vnder thoſe his tranſgreſſions, this to reſpect and the ſame to performe which in this deſperate and dangerous caſe, is the beſt counſail we may giue him for remedy and eaſe. For ſurely, ſurely, God being thus prouoked and that iuſtly, he will not be appeazed, nor will he ſurceaſe to ſtreatch forth his hand of iuſtice againſt him ſo offending, vntill that he meekly acknowledge his offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before him, repent, and ſeeke him with ſorrow and ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of heart, as we may ſee in th'examples of our forefathers both in the wildernes vnder the conduct of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> and in this land vnder the gouernment of our wiſe and valiant Iudges. Now (my Lords) hereof is it, that <hi>Iehovah</hi> our God being moſt iuſtly diſpleaſed with our Lord the King, hee hath in iuſtice ſtirred vp and prouoked againſt him (beſides the

               <p>* But yet in this interim, to the aggrauating of the kinges griefe, it is fallen out of late (whereof the King is alſo certified, for what can be hidden from his eyes) that when this fellow <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboham</hi> departed from Ieruſalem, the Prophet <hi>Ahiah</hi> the <hi>Sylonite</hi> found him in the way hauing a new garment on him and they two being alone in the field, the Prophet caught that new garment and rent it in twelue peeces,<note place="margin">

Neither may any of vs thinke otherwiſe, but that the king, and his words and life are obſerued and noted by others, not onely his friends, but his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies alſo:<note place="margin">The words, the liues, and behaviour of princes are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued of the people.</note> and ſo much the ſooner, becauſe hee is the King, on whom before all others, the eyes of all the people are bent, as on a famous citie ſet on an hill: or as on a light on the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And truely the errors and meane faultes of Princes (whoſe liues are ſet foorth to bee ſéene, obſerued and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of many) appeare often wonderfull great, as in the face of a man a little webbe or ſcarre is ſooner ſeene and diſliked, then a farre greater ſpot or blemiſh in any other the parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And then, as the eclipſing or defect of the Sunne bringeth a great annoyance to the earth, and no leſſe calamitie to men, and other inferiour treaſures: thoſe faults and errors of the king, who ſhould chiefly direct all others to the common good, and higheſt felicitie engender no ſmall perturbation and other great inconueniencies in the affaires of his Kingdome and Common-wealth.<note place="margin">An admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to princes.</note> Therefore it is meet, that the king, and ſuch high eſtates do walke aduiſedly, both in word &amp; deed, with honourable behauior: and that Princes bee right wary, that they neither doe nor ſuffer to be done any thing which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues would not that the people ſhould not obſerue or imitate, or iuſtly diſlike in them: aboue all, they muſt regard, that they neither commit nor command any thing contrary to the Law of God, and the honour of that place wherein they that ſtand are called <hi>Gods</hi>: becauſe they repreſent the Maieſtie of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7975:117"/>
God, and raigne by his prouidence and power, to doe equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and righteouſneſſe vnto the people. And heerein obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving dutie they ſtand devoyd of all dreade, honoured of their Subiects and others, and goe foorth moſt couragiouſly in their lawfull enterpriſes, no more reſpecting the ſiniſter talkes of their malicious enemies, then the great barbed hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes feare of thoſe little Curres which barke at their heeles. But when theſe rules bee neither obſerued nor followed, both the honour of the place is diſtained by thoſe perſons, and themſelues in fine requited with obloquie and diffame. For as the great ramping Lyon ſo gréedy of his pray, is made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid both at the crowing of the Cocke, and at the ſight of the Cockeſ-combe: ſo many mightie and high Potentates of the earth in the knowledge of their owne ſlidings haue been won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully annoyed and aſtoniſhed, both by the hard reportes of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meane perſons, and by their churliſh behauior towards them and their honor vpon ſuch occaſions. And I doe no leſſe feare, that both the reports which are carryed abroad, and the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men with their demeanure occaſioned thereby towards the king, hath both much diſgraced his high magnificencie, and diſquieted his happy peace. Moreouer, there be, which ſtick not to except againſt his gouernment. For as the rule wherby men worke, muſt firſt be made ſtraight and plaine, before the worke can thereby be either corrected or directed: ſo a prince ought to be free from all heinous vices: yea, it is required that he be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and ſound in all princely vertues, before hee be able to rule well or to correct, or to direct others. Neither indeede (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the wiſeſt) haue ſuch perſons beene eſteemed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to beare rule, in the affayres of a Kingdome, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct guide, and direct others, in the Church, which haue not throughly ſubdued their affections, reſtrained their appetites, abandoned their luſtes, and bridled their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall paſſions. Truely theſe, and ſuch like are the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry matters nowe in queſtion, and much ruminated among the very ruſticall and Countrey people, in ſuch ſorte, as the eares of them that heare the ſame may glowe, the King himſelfe may bee ſorie, and all wee of his Court vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſhamed.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Although that King <hi>Solomon</hi> hath in his time farre excelled all the kings in the world in wiſedome, wealth, glory and other things of the highest requeſt: yet beyond all expectation, he hath wonderfully tranſgreſſed &amp; ſinned againſt God, againſt his people, against his own honour.</hi> And with this they bring foorth againſt him all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer my Lorde <hi>Zadok</hi> hath ſaide before, and a great deale more. Wherein they point at him, as at one of the fooles of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> farre vnmeete the dignitie of his place, honor of his calling, and reuerence of his Age. for, as he beſt knoweth the nature of all hearbs and beaſtes, hee ſhould in this (they ſay) haue imitated the nature of either the hearbe, or of the beaſt <hi>Chamoeleon</hi>: whereof the one will euer change the colour of her leaues to the qualitie of the place wherein ſhee groweth: and the other will reſemble the colours and ſhewes obiected.

This the king knewe well-enough: for hee wanted no wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, no knowledge, no vnderſtanding, no iudgement. But that notwithſtanding, hee abuſed both his calling, place and age, whereof it is, that as they which come out of hote bathes doe ſodainely coole more vehemently, and as that water which hath beene once heate, ſeemeth to bee more colde then any other: and as they moſt deadly hate one another, which haue beene ſometimes friendes when they fall at variance: ſo turning himſelfe from the Lorde his God, and from the vſe of thoſe princely and heroicall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, wherein hee was firſt exerciſed; hee is eſteemed exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable wicked in the eyes of wiſemen. Therefore, <hi>There bee among them, which doe not onely call into question his election, and remiſsion, but alſo doe iudge him a perſon prophane, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate and damnable, and ſo not meete to bee a King, much

                  </hi> For as the iudgement of the tree is taken from the conſideration of the fruite, and of the fountaines by the taſte or vſe of the waters: ſo gather they this cenſure from the conſideration of the kings life and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, for whiles a man continueth wallowing in ſinne, without true repentance, he declareth no pardon: and he whoſe ſinnes are not pardoned hath none hope of health. Againe, he that repenteth not of his ſinnes when he hath ſinned, is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſon, he that obtaineth not mercy is a reprobate: and he that is ſhut out from ſaluation is damned. Howbeit, the Lord forbidde, that this thing ſhould bee found or iuſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in our Lorde the King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Herence, alſo they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect againſt the <hi>ſermons, wordes,</hi>

For I eſteeme it an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to my ſelfe to bee thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy by your wiſedomes to ſpeake, and to haue your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in the defence of my Lorde the King, and his cauſe. Neither doe I thinke, but that in conſcience and dutie I am holden ſo to doe: for it in not meete that I ſhoulde heare my good Lorde, and his wordes to bee ſclandered or euill reported, and to paſſe it ouer in ſilence, yea, I ſhall be thought therein to giue conſent to thoſe ſiniſter reports. And firſt, as touching the king:<note place="margin">The king is not to be iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in his ſins nor excuſed.</note> it cannot bee denyed, but that hee hath (indeede) wonderfully doated on his ſtrange wiues, and hath hearkened too much to them, which euer retaining that euill opinion and cuſtome, would neuer receiue nor admit that counſell which the wiſeſt of all men liuing gaue them, and hath beene by them allured, ſeduced and led away from <hi>Iehovah</hi> his God, againſt whole Maieſtie (by their inſtigation) hee hath wrought wickedneſſe.

                  <note place="margin">The Church is like an houſe.</note> And firſt (as ye haue heard and doe perceiue) the Church of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> is prefigured and expreſſed wholy by an houſe: and that conueniently in regarde of the partes, orders, and vſe thereof. But this houſe hath two generall partes, whereof the one is that, in the which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well the people, as the prieſtes do enter, wherein they pray they teach, they heare, they offer ſacrifice, they praiſe God, they talke and declare their holy deuotion and obedience to God and the law in their ſeuerall places and functions: th'other generall parte is that <hi>holieſt place,</hi> into the which none but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the high Prieſt and that once in the yeere enireth to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice aſwell for himſelfe, as for the people.

<pb facs="tcp:7975:129"/>
By the which is not vnaptly ſignified mans mortall body in this world: the which neuertheleſſe, being once rent or diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the gate or entrance is made open of the paſſage from the one part to the other. For by this, we paſſe out of the troubles and confuſion of this place, into the place of glorie. This Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hath a foundation ſtrong and permanent: by the which is ſignified the power and might of <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> who beeing beſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſupport and beare the burden and building of his Church hath laid the ſame on himſelfe, as that ſure rocke of reſt, vpon the which whatſoeuer is faſt grounded ſhall ſtand and neuer fall. This is the ſame, by whome our fathers in the wilderneſſe were relieued and ſtrengthned. This Temple hath alſo walles ſtanding on that foundation, raiſed vp of framed ſtones, and ſet well in order: by the which we vnderſtand the goodly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of holy men, rightly diſpoſed and well ordered in the ſame. There bee alſo windowes to giue in the light: By the which are ment the order of the wiſe teachers &amp; miniſters in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame: There be pretious ſtones, which note the moſt excellent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Prophets, Prieſtes, and Magiſtrates. There bee two Altars, wherof the one is of gold, ſtanding in the holieſt place th'other is of braſſe ſtanding in the other part. By the former, we conſider the merite of <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> by the other the pure heart of the holy ones. On the one is offered the ſame vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted Lambe, vnto which all the ſacrificed Lambes of our law do point: on the other, is lifted vp that ſacrifice of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, faith, thankſgiuing and righteouſnes, where of King <hi>David</hi> hath ſpoken. There bee alſo <hi>Cherubins</hi> in the holieſt place: which note thoſe Angels and miniſtring Spirits which ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the heauenly preſence, are moſt obedient to his wil, and euen ready to helpe, ſuccour and comfort the Saincts which are on the earth. There bee lights and Candles in number ten: By the lights are ment the doctrine of the right knowledge of God by the which the people are taught and inſtructed: and by the Candleſtickes wee may conſider that diuine law vnto the which hee woulde that all thoſe doctrines and inſtructions ſhoulde drawe men, and to note the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof (as alluding to the tenne commaundementes in

Moreouer, on the walles bee certaine pictures moſt gloriouſly beautified, which expreſſe the noble graces, and vertues of thoſe liuely ſtones, I meane the ſaints: and withall diuers other things right beautifull and moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, which alſo are to bee applyed to ſo many ſundry fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, adminiſtrations, duties offices &amp; vertues, in the Church of <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> of the which I may not preſently delate, nor may as yet preſume to vnfold that, which I know ſhall be ſhut vp and faſt ſealed from the perfect knowledge of man,<note place="margin">Many things were ſealed vp from mans knowledge before the comming of Meſſiah,</note> vntill the comming of that moſt holy one. <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe could ſee but the very <hi>backe partes</hi> of him, whom he deſired to behold, and things which ſhall be indeede, are as obſcurely ſhadowed vnto vs, as yet.

But hearken againe. As it hath well pleaſed the <hi>Almightie</hi> to elect king <hi>Solomon,</hi> to appoint him the builder of his houſe,<note place="margin">Solomon in his dignitie prefigureth Chriſt.</note> to honor his birth, and to entitle him with thoſe moſt ſoueraigne <hi>Names</hi>: ſo hath hee made him king ouer his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to doe vnto them equitie and righteouſneſſe. And this the Lorde did in his loue to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">1. king. 10.</note> as the noble <hi>Queene of Saba</hi> ſaid at her being here: and ſo ſaid <hi>Hyram</hi> the king of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> writing to the king: <hi>Becauſe the Lord loved <hi>Iſrael,</hi> therefore hath he placed the king over them.</hi> Wherein, wee ſee how he typeth the holy <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> for inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Lord loued his Church (I meane all thoſe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ones, whom he had before elected and purpoſed to glorifie in the end) he made his <hi>Meſsiah</hi> their Prince and Captaine. He gaue vnto them in his good pleaſure, ſuch a king, as might ſit vpon mount <hi>Sion,</hi> from whence he had expelled all the halt and the blinde, that this king of the right <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thumim</hi> might be placed, and raigne therein, doing righteouſneſſe and equitie vnto his Saints. If therefore the Lorde loued <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and in his pleaſure placed ouer them a king, whom he alſo loued, and by the ſame would prefigurate both his <hi>Meſsiah</hi> &amp; his Church, what ſhould let vs in this to conclude for the kings holineſſe? Moreouer, the end of this gouernment ſhooteth to the ſame ſcope: which is <hi>to doe equitie and righteouſnes.</hi> This our king endeuoured to his power, and ſo much performed, as a mortall man could: but the full perfection thereof indeede is reſerued to the <hi>moſt holy ſeede,</hi> which is appointed to combine the Lords <hi>Iuſtice</hi> with his <hi>Mercie,</hi> &amp; therof conclude <hi>Equitie:</hi> when lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mans guilt on himſelfe, hee ſhall beare the ſtrokes of the

diuine iuſtice: and imputing his perfection vnto man, hee ſhall procure him pardon. Thus ſhall iuſtice be adminiſtred, &amp; yet mercy ſhall not be abandoned: but one thing ſo conſidered with another, that both righteouſneſſe and equitie ſhall bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. This worke (I ſay) is proper to the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in therefore our Lord king <hi>Solomon</hi> ſtandeth a true figure.

And in truth, as thoſe perſons which haue bruiſed frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and beene enſenced therewith doe ſmell of the ſame, neither will they by and by loſe the ſauour and ſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, though they bee purged: ſo the King, hauing beene en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the diuine Spirite, and long exerciſed in the vſe of the right Princely and ſacred vertues, doeth yet, and ſhall enioy the ſweete ſauor and acceptable memorie of the ſame, neither may ſo ſhort a time (as this life is) blotte it out. Whereby being enboldened, hee may therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne them that ſhall either diſdayne him, or vniuſtly iudge of either him, his wordes, or actions.</p>
               <p>But nowe, becauſe the Kings <hi>Remiſſion</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,</hi>

For they will reply, and thus obiect: It may bee, that hee was a Saint, and ſeruant of <hi>Iehovah</hi> his GOD, ſo long as hee kept his minde chaſte, his body cleane, his actions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reproofe, and the trueth of his doctrine pure and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted: Or ſo long as hee well pleaſed GOD, who iuſtifieth the beleeuing ſinner: or ſo long as hee was ordained to ſtand the figure of the holy <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee ſheened in perfite beautie: but afterwarde in his tranſgreſſions and ſinnes he turned his beautie into ougly deformitie. Nor indeede, according to your former words, coulde hee poſſibly bee and remayne the figure of the holy <hi>Meſsiah</hi> longer, then whiles his beautie remayned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite in him. Therefore, except hee were forgiuen, and by this his remiſſion clenſed and reſtored to his former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, or at the leaſted admitted into the fauour of GOD,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7975:135"/>
and iuſtified, the former doubt will be ſtill retained, and vrged againſt both him and his words. Therefore let it pleaſe you to reſolue this doubt and ſatiſfie vs therein, as we know yee are well able (moſt reuerend Father). To this anſwered <hi>Zadok.</hi> I am moſt willing both to reſolue this doubt, and to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie you (my Lords all) in this caſe: therefore, to proue that the King hath obtained mercie and pardon of the Lord God for all thoſe his tranſgreſſions, and ſo conſequently ſtandeth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth a Saint and perſon dedicated to the Lorde, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all thoſe his tranſgreſſions, I thus reaſon for my Lord the king. * <hi>Whoſoeuer hath truely repented him of his ſinnes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Solomon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined mercie, for he repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him of his ſinnes.</note> 
                  <hi>hee hath obtained mercie and forgiveneſſe: But our Lord King <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> hath truely repented him of his ſins, therfore he hath obtained mercy and forgeveneſſe.</hi> The firſt propoſition is prooued by many ſounde Arguments and poſitions of holy Scriptures. And firſt by the due conſideration of the Nature of GOD, who as hee hath created man to his owne image and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and hath a will to preſerue him, ſo deſireth hee nothing more then his conuerſion and amendement after his fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as whereby hee may not bee hindered, but furthered and bolpen in his walking towardes the higheſt Glorie: yea, in this hee reſembleth a true father that both pitieth and pardoneth his owne ſonne which hath offended him, vpon his true repentance, as both <hi>Moſes, Iob,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> of famous memorie haue tolde vs, with other our holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who teache and aſſure vs, from the Lordes owne mouth, that if an vngodly man will turne away from all his ſinnes that hee, hath done, and keepe all his Statutes; and doe the thing that is iudgement and right, hee ſhall doubtleſſe liue and not die: neither ſhall his ſinnes bee ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther retained or mentioned vnto him: for God hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the death of a ſinner: but gladly will bee mercifull vnto him, and pardon him vpon his repentance. For God is moſt readie to forgiue. Therefore hee comforteth vs with this ſaying: Circumciſe the fore-ſkinnes of your heartes:<note place="margin">Deut.</note> caſt away your tranſgreſſions, and turne againe vnto <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,</hi> your God, and yee ſhall not dye but liue. And this is that which wee beleeue, and perſuade of our Lorde the
<pb facs="tcp:7975:136"/>
king. Surely, <hi>Cain</hi> himſelfe (though too preſumpſuous and proude in his ſinnes) could inregard hereof ſay: and is my ſinne greater,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> then that it can bee pardoned? Knowing, that the promiſe which GOD had made to <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radize,</hi> both imported and included remiſſion, ſaying, that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> that is, the Seede of the Woman ſhoulde breake the Serpents heade, whereof man, though an execrable ſinner ſhoulde finde both remiſſion and life, with <hi>Iehovah his</hi> GOD. Next to this wee haue a great many comfortable examples, in the Bookes of <hi>Moſes, Iob, Ioſuah,</hi> the <hi>Iudges,</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> as of the pardon offered vnto <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, Lot,</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and to bee briefe, to <hi>David</hi> the Kings father, to whome the Lorde ſayde by <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet: <hi>God hath put away thy ſinnes, thou ſhalt not die,</hi> the which hee often remembred in the Booke of the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">pſal. 103.3</note> whereof hee alſo prouoketh his ſoule to the praiſe of GOD, who had forgiuen him all his iniquitie and couered all his ſinne. Nowe, as none can forgiue ſinnes, but God onely: ſo thoſe our anceſtors, when they ſinned, perſwading that all their ſinnes were done againſt God, either immediately or by meanes, they would in the hope of remiſſion and health repaire vnto him, ſeeking firſt to bee reconciled with his grace, before they would goe vnto men, remembering what olde <hi>Eli</hi> the Prieſt,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 2.</note> ſaide ſome-times to his children. If a man ſinne againſt man (ſayde hee) the Iudge may decide it: but if a man ſinne againſt GOD, who ſhall bee his Vmpire, or Dayes-man? Moreouer, knowing that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don required precedent <hi>Repentance,</hi> without the which, who will forgiue him that offendeth him among men: they neither preſumed to approach the diuine throne with proud, inſolent and preſumptuous Spirites but with contrite and humble heartes, deſiring mercie for ſinnes committed and confeſſed with great ſubmiſſion. For albeit, that <hi>Repentance</hi> be very ſharpe and bitter to the ſinner and many men had lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſinne openly, then repent ſecretly: yet is this the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine of treſpaſſes, the conſumption of iniquities, a weapon againſt Satan, and a ſharpe ſworde prepared and able to daunt the deadly aduerſarie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:7975:136"/>This is the hope of health, the purchaſe of mercie and way to felicitie: I cannot yet ceaſe, but ſpeake againe of this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne treaſure, and medicine of the ſinners ſore, beeing therein as full as the Moone, and moſt willing to bee pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red foorth in the excellencie thereof, ſo full of conſolation, and rich bleſſings. This is that, which (through the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the liuing God in the promiſed ſeede) remitteth ſinnes, openeth the gates of <hi>Paradize,</hi> ſalueth the man that is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in heart, and gladeth them that bee ſorowfull. This is that, which calleth a mans life from deſtruction, reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his eſtate, reneweth his decayed honour, giueth him boldneſſe, reformeth his ſpirites, and powreth in grace vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on grace.</p>
               <p>This is that, which looſeth things bounde, clarifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth things obſcure and animateth things deſperate. The beautie of this vertue is as cleare, as the Sunne: as bright as the Moone, as gliſtring as the Starres. The ſweetnes thereof is as honye, the price as golde, and the eſtimation beyonde all precious ſtones: For this is that, which neither ſinne ouer-commeth, nor defection deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, nor diſpaire blotteth out. Finally, this abandoneth all vices, imbraceth all vertues, tormenteth ſinne, extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth righteouſneſſe, obtaineth mercies, produceth vertues, freeth ſinners, recouereth the loſt, recreateth the deſperate,<note place="margin">He that can truely repent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> needeth not to doubt of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> refreſheth the harde labourer, and bringeth to her poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors eternall happineſſe. For by this a man ſhall bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, although hee hath lead all his life in ſinne (as there is no man which ſinneth not, full often and euery day.) Such an excellent thing is <hi>true Repentance</hi>! But yee will ſaye?

Indeede, this thing is not wrought in man of mans owne power nor wiſedome, For GOD ſtayeth not to expect it from mans wiſedome or abilitie, (for ſo may both his expectation bee fruſtrated, and man bee deceiued) but it is the goodneſſe of GOD to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newe them by repentance, which are waxen olde in ſinne.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Sinner ſhoulde neuer deſpaire,<note place="margin">Deſpaire not of mercie.</note> nor fall from hope: neither ſhoulde hee bee aſhamed to repent,

For as the wood whoſe nature is to ſwimme on the water, may yet beeing ouer-laden with yron ſinke, but the yron beeing taken off, the wood ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles aſcendeth againe to the head of the water and ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth: Neither may we ſay, that it is no wood, becauſe it did ſinke once to the bottome:<note place="margin">Though the faithfull fall, yet they riſe vp againe,</note> So though the righteous men whoſe nature is by Faith to ſtand and walke in Gods way, being oppreſſed with the burthen of ſinne through the deuils malice,

do vnhappily couch downe (as with <hi>Iſachar</hi> between two bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens) yet may we not rightly ſaye, that they are not of the Lords choſen: for it is ſo, that whenſoeuer that burden is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued (as it is from them that repent) they riſe againe and bee renued, as in their former eſtate, and beeing of that generation and nature, it is not poſſible that they ſhoulde fall vtterly away: for the ſonnes of God do not ſo apoſtate that they fall into eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall perdition, howſoeuer they ſinne and ſinke vnder their ſins.

<pb facs="tcp:7975:140"/>
and by wicked apoſtaſy fallen away from him for euer: for had it beene ſo, we ſhould not haue ſeene him in this his eſtate. And as I well remember, I heard the king himſelfe to ſay (and wee cannot denye it, when we well conſider thereof and of him in this his eſtate) that in the depth of thoſe his ſinnes and vanities he perceiued that yet <hi>his wiſedome remained with him</hi>:<note place="margin">pſal. 51.11. 1.

For, there is no ſinne whatſoeuer which a man committeth, wherein there is not a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> turning away of the ſinner from the Lord, for ſinne is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the law of God, and argueth a contempt of his iuſtice, &amp; neglect of his graces; therefore the Lorde requireth in them, whom he recoureth and pardoneth a faithful returne in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> contrition. Next it is true, that euery man is led away from God of his owne concupiſcence or naturall luſts, and thus the King doting ouermuch on his ſtrange Woemen hath been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, ouercome in affection, ſeduced and led away from the Lordes righteouſnes. Thirdly the king by thoſe former occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> had forſaken his firſt loue, was waxen more colde, or luke-warme, in that holy religion, and godly zeale with the which his heart hath been wonderfully enflamed in his youth.

                  </note> but that hath and yet doth remaine the ſame as in the time of <hi>David,</hi> notwithſtanding the idolatries, ſuperſtitions and prouocations of his ſtrange women: which is a notable argument, that yet thee helde the ſure foundation of his ſaith vnſhaken. And therefore let vs not preſume either to ſay or to thinke, that King <hi>Solomon</hi> is fallen vtterly away from the Lord his God, who hath ſo wonderfully loued, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and bleſſed him. It is one thing to offend God by euill thoughts, euill wordes or wicked deedes: another thing to deny God and to forſake him vtterly. He that ſinneth and offendeth God, and yet beleeueth in God, he is by his repentance reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for ſaluation: but who ſo doth deny God and vtterly apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate from him, there remaineth vnto him not ſo much as one little ſhell wherewith he may drawe a very ſmall meaſure of the water of life. It is not one and the ſame thing to turne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lorde and to turne vtterly awry from him without retyre or returne: The former of theſe faults is often ſeene in Gods owne children, when (like prodigall and diſobedient ſonnes) they bee tempted to depart from their moſt louing father, and yet do returne home againe, &amp; are renued by repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as were <hi>Aaron, Moſes, David</hi>: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> latter is ſeene in the reprobates on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which fall away and neuer returne, and therefore are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued by repentance: for they cannot truely repent,<note place="margin">The repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates cannot truely repent.</note> becauſe the Lord giueth not repentance vnto them: as it was apparant in <hi>Cain,</hi> in <hi>Lots</hi> wiſe, &amp; in <hi>Saul,</hi> whom the Lord caſt away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before him.

In the meane time (my good L) let vs think right honourably of the K. and beleeue that <hi>Iehovah</hi> his God hath not barred him out from the contrition and repentance of the bleſſed and ſo neither from the diuine mercy.

And truely in this, that hee hath acknowledged and confeſſed his offences, hee may not bee either condemned or diſliked, albeit hee bee the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> no more then ſuch a thing was blamed in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> his father: but rather to be commended, as it was in him: as firſt in regard of the good example, wherby others might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed: next for the more eaſe of his own heart oppreſſed with ſorrow in the conſideration of his ſin with the danger enſewing it. Thirdly for the better pacifying of the diuine wrath which is veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t againſt obſtinat ſinners: and fouthly for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good of his people, who vpon his repentance and remiſſion might hope for peace: there be ſome who when they haue ſinned, will not eaſily acknowledge themſelues faultie either to God or to man: and therfore are hardly perſwaded to amend. Wherin they bee like thoſe which holden of deſperate diſeaſes not feeling themſelues ſick, are hardly recouered: for this is a great hindera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life, when men which are offenders will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their offences. But there bee ſome (though not many of them) which offending, do by times feele and know their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſeek to eſcape the diuine wrath by a faithful reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſo are recouered in good time.

Next, the king <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> hath in this ſort fallen, that as in his wiſedome and diuine ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues he did prefigurate the holy <hi>Meſsiah:</hi> ſo by thoſe his ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and the ſinnes of his wiues, and ſtrange women impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alſo vnto him, (in that he both affected &amp; maintained them, notwithſtanding their blemiſhes in religion) hee might fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew the burthen of mans ſinnes, layd and imputed to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one, on whoſe héele therefore the Serpent was to treade, in the regard whereof, hee ſhall bee both reputed and eſteemed vile and of no reputation among the children of men, and ſhall be puniſhed for their tranſgreſſions, as <hi>David</hi> hath propheſied

thereof: Beſides that, in this declination of the Kings honor, is noted the renting and finall diſſipation of our Nation and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> gouernment in time to come. Thirdly: the Lorde God will, that this example of the Kings fall, ſhould bee a terrour and document to all others in poſteritie, how proſperous or glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſoeuer they ſhall bee in this worlde full of Vanitie, that they beware how they preſumne on any ornament either of body or minde, or any thing elſe of this preſent life: and that they promiſe not to themſelues the aſſurance and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vſe of that which is but lent them, and not their owne to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine or diſpoſe: for if God hath ſuffered the king, who enioyed all theſe things at his full pleaſure, to fall, yea, and to worke wickednes againſt his owne honor, &amp; for theſe his ſinnes hath laden him with a meaſure of his iudgements; why ſhould any other man aſſure himſelfe the continuall poſſeſſion of the like, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> which yet come farre behinde the King in all things? Laſtly, by this, the Lord would ſchole and teach the king (as wiſe as he is) that hee preſume not to enter into iudgement with him, which is moſt iuſt, and will not acquite a ſinner in his ſinnes: nor to iuſtifie himſelfe before him, in whoſe ſight the very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels be vncleane: nor that he might thinke himſelfe righteous in his owne power, before the throne of that King, in whoſe preſence no fleſh liuing can be iuſtified: but that rather (in the conſideration of his imperfections and the bitter ſenſe of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine diſpleaſure) he ſhould acknowledge and confeſſe his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and by a godly repentance ſtriue to reſurge vnto that from whence he was fallen, as his father did. *But here I call to minde,<note place="margin">Why Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vſed not the holy name Tetragram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maton: in his Booke of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles?</note> that <hi>Abiather</hi> obiected further againſt the king and his wordes, namely in this, that <hi>hee had not of late vſed, nor remembred in his common talke, the glorious Name <hi>Iehovah,</hi>

As for the former which is taught men by the old ſubtle Serpent, the King well knoweth, that it is very vanitie, for this wiſdome reſpecteth not the thinges that bee pure, peaceable and diuine: but the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of this life, being terrene, ſenſuall,<note place="margin">zadoke his anſwere.

mirth which is proper to mans nature. And ſuch perſons as are light minded, and exceſſiue and vnmeaſurable in their ſportes and laughters, hee might worthily call <hi>madde perſons</hi> or <hi>fooles</hi>: For as they are prophane and fooliſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, ſo they bewray themſelues eſpecially to the wiſe and contrite in heart, as madde and moſt vnwiſe. For by this, they vnfolde the leuitie of their carnall minds, they hinder in themſelues and others the ſtudies of thinges pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, they ſhut out from their heartes the feare of God they forget their owne condition in this life, they be made meere vnfit for true repentance: and to bee ſhort, they commonly finiſh thoſe kinde of ſportes and laughters in payne, ſorrow and lamentation.<note place="margin">Pleaſures are pronoſticati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of future paines.</note> For it is often ſéene that ſuch vnmeaſurable ſportes and pleaſures are pronoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of imminent troubles and great afflictions, the which beſides dayly and ordinary experience, is taught and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by many examples and argumentes aſwell of the bruite Creatures, as of others ſo worthy conſideration.

Thus our Fathers the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> plaied and ſported in the wildernes and leapt and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before the Calfe which <hi>Aaron</hi> had made: but within a whiles after followed on them a great ſlaughter:<note place="margin">Exo. 32.27.</note> for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man ſlew his brother, euery man his companion, and euery man his neighbor.

This was the ſame which the Kings mother diſliked chiefly in a king, when ſchooling him (yet but a child) ſhe ſaid:<note place="margin">pro. 31.4.</note>

Therfore ſhe ſaid againe to him: <hi>Give the strong drinke vnto him that is ready to perriſh and wine vnto them that haue griefe of heart. Let him drinke that he may forget his povertie and remember his affliction no more</hi>: It was lawfull for righteous <hi>Noah</hi> to drinke of wine to comfort his heart after his trauailes on the ſtood: but it was not lawful for him to be drunken therwith: the like may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued of <hi>Lot</hi> and of <hi>Solomon</hi> our K. Therefore in his godly confeſſion he ſaid not, I wil drinke, or vſe wine: but that he ſaide as vnto his heart, <hi>I wil power thee out in wine,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, I wil apply my ſelfe to the luſt of wine,<note place="margin">Iudg. 9.13.</note> &amp; ſwim or abounde exceſſiuely therein.

But this one thing I may remember w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the former, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the K. found by his experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (as he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed) that impoſſible it was for him to lead that kind of life,<note place="margin">pietie and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſnes may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre.</note> &amp; neuertheles retaine the diuine feare within his heart. For as GOD would not permit, that one and the ſame altar ſhoulde ſerue for himſelfe and for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Idol <hi>Dagon</hi> too, ſo wil he not, that voluptuouſneſſe and ſinne ſhoulde bee ſet to bee adored there where his Spirite inhabiteth, for hee is a iealous God. Therefore as there is placed a diuiſion betweene light and darkeneſſe:
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:7975:167"/>
ſo is there ſet a great difference and ſpace betweene wiſedome and wine in that abuſe, between godlines and carnal pleaſures, betweene pietie and impietie, righteouſnes and ſinne. Neither let any man imagine, that together with the one hee may holde or retayne the other no more then our fathers could reliſh both <hi>Manna</hi> and Egypt fare in the deſert, yee haue then anſwered ſufficiently to this obiection, moſt reuerend Father.<label type="milestone">

                  </label> It is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obiected that the King condemneth diuers other the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and workes of Kinges, yea all the pleaſures of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men, which in commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſtimation are not only pleaſant but profitable too: as namely <hi>the effecting of mighty workes, the building of great houſes, the planting of fruitfull vineyardes,</hi> the making of pleaſant Paradiſes and faire gardens, the framing of Ceſternes of water to water the woods that grow, with the trées, the multiplying of ſeruants and maides, and of children to be borne in his houſe: to procure great ſtore of Beefes and ſheepe to gather ſiluer and gold, &amp; the chiefe treaſures of Kings and prouinces: to get men-ſingers, and women-ſingers,<note place="margin">Eccles. 2.4.11</note> and the delights of the ſonnes of men &amp;c. For hee hath ſaide, when he looked on all thoſe thinges: Beholde, I haue found all vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and there is no profit vnder the ſunne. To this anſwered <hi>Zadoke:</hi> As I haue ſaid before of the true vſe of Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: ſo ſay I in this, that lawfull it is not onely for kinges and princes: but alſo for other men (after their power and place to haue and vſe all thoſe thinges: but the limited boundes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tranſgreſſed, the vanity thereof appeareth, and that indéed not ſeldome, ſeeing there be very few, who hauing them at full can meaſure their appetites, and be contained within the limits of their vocation. Hereof we know, that it is not enough for men to haue riches, wealth, honours, pleaſures and ſuch like: except that they alſo meaſure themſelues well, and apply the thinges to their right ends. For God hath giuen and diſpoſed his giftes diuerſly to diuers perſons, to this end, that they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him in the vſe of them, doe good therewith one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and diſcharge their proper duties in their places.<note place="margin">A cooling carde for worldly men, who ſeke feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of theſe things</note> Laſtly, the King hauing learned the leſſon of true <hi>conſideration,</hi> did in the end confeſſe, that in al thoſe things he could find no <hi>contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp; ſo neither felicitie: but that indeed he found great vanitie
<pb facs="tcp:7975:168"/>
and vexation of his ſpirite. Alas then what ſhoulde other men hope to finde? Might not this ſtoppe the mouths of them, who ſay, that then they ſhoulde bee happy had they the wealth, the riches, the power, the honors, and the pleaſures of glorious king <hi>Solomon?</hi> as if, forſooth that in thoſe terrene and tranſitorie thinges the true happines of man conſiſted. But truly as they bewray their corrupt iudgement and error in and about this chiefe principle: ſo if (by the will and pleaſure of God) they had therein their deſire, it is not only poſſible, but moſt certain, that they woulde tranſgreſſe and offend farre beyond the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and offences of King <hi>Solomon:</hi> and wanting that wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which he had to guide and direct them, they would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare themſelues the greateſt fooles in the worlde. For man beeing in honor, without vnderſtanding, is compared to the Beaſts which periſh, as King <hi>David</hi> ſaid, when he beheld both the vpriſing, and downe falling of many ſuch perſons, as hauing the things of this worlde at will, could neither vſe the ſame to their own good, nor with the ſame defend and preſerue themſelues from euill, albeit, (eſtéeming the ſame aboue God and all goodneſſe) they placed therein their higheſt and chiefe felicitie. In regarde whereof, the pleaſures, honors, glory and proſperity of this world are compared to a ſhining candle, which for the time it burneth giueth a glorious light, but the ſubſtance whereof it is maintained beeing conſumed, the ſame commeth all to ſmoke and ſtinche: for the time will come when thou ſhalt grant and confeſſe with the King, that all theſe thinges are vanitie, and vexation of the ſoule, &amp; that not ſo much in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde of the thinges themſelues, as of thine owne abuſe and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious thoughts in and concerning the ſame.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:7975:171"/>
and yet how haſtie are they to iudge of that they neither know nor are able to apprehend. Thus the blind-man is ſaid to iudge of colours. Howbeit, ye ſhall conſider with me, that the king hath not ſaid it abſolutely or ſimply that the <hi>wiſe-man</hi> is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the <hi>foole,</hi> but in this ſenſe &amp; meaning: Firſt, as we vſe to ſay, that Fooles haue fortune: meaning that a wiſe-man by his proper wiſedom, ſtudie, and power can effect nothing more, then doth a foole of any thing he takes in hand, without the wil, wiſedom, power and prouidence of God: becauſe things are not placed in the will and abilitle of man, but as moſt meete re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine for euer in the will and power of God, who often giueth the ſame Lot to the foole, as he doth to the wiſe-man of this worlde.

Otherwiſe, we may not think but that the godly,<note place="margin">The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that be dead are at reſt.</note> the faithfull and the righteous which bee dead, as <hi>Noah, Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Iſaack, Iacob, Moſes, Samuel, Ioſeph</hi> and ſuch, are in better caſe, then they which yet liue. For they bee bleſſed and no paine can oppreſſe or touch them. Therfore this is the deſire of them that here liue in the Lord <hi>That they may be diſſolved to die, and dwell with the Lord in eternall happines.</hi> In the like ſort hath the king ſpoken touching him which is not yet borne. For he ſaith not abſolutely, that he which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,<note place="margin">He that is not yet borne is happier.</note> nor he which ſhall not be borne, nor he that is not and ſhall neuer be, is happier them he which liueth and is, but, that after the iudgement of men, in regard of thoſe mightie troubles that ouertake men in the world, it ſeemeth to be better not to be at all, then to be made ſubiect and thrall to thoſe troubles. And yet, who knoweth not (which hath wiſedome) that the King might ſpeake ſo touching the wicked which nowe liue in the worlde, and are appointed to eternall torment and miſerie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death. For in this reſpect, the pooreſt wretch that euer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the worlde, nowe by death tranſlated into Celeſtiall happineſſe, is by thouſands preferred before the higheſt Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, or Lord that liueth on the earth, and (by his Tyranny,

oppreſſion, and heynous iniquities) is by the iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of GOD ordained for the fyer of <hi>Tophet</hi> and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall miſerie. Otherwiſe I knowe well, that the King preferreth not death before life, nor the dead before the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, knowing that GOD hath made life for his glorie, and men in this life to ſet foorth the ſame. Neither is he ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of this (as hee is moſt wiſe) that as the righteous which bee departed from this worlde are happyer then they which yet liue and ſuſtaine and féele the miſeries of the ſame: ſo is it much better for them to bee as they are, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding oppreſſed in this worlde, with all the miſeries thereof, in full hope and aſſurance of eternall felicitie, then that they ſhould not bee at all. Finally, if the wordes might bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken without reſpect or relation to the miſerable affayres of men in the kingdome of vanitie, who will not beleeue, that thoſe holy <hi>Patriarches</hi> and Fathers, which are layd vp in peace, are more happy then any of vs which nowe liue: and that the holy <hi>Meſsiah</hi> whom the King prefigureth, not yet borne, but to bee borne heereafter, is farre to bee preferred and extolled for happineſſe and honour before ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of both?

For there hee ſpake of the godly minde which is content with whatſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe God to giue it, and eſteemeth more of that little with quietneſſe in the feare of God, which (indeed) is great riches to the godly minde: but here he ſpeaketh of the idle and ſluggiſh perſon: or of him that is wearie or diſcouraged in the performance of his office or dutie, by reaſon of the common emulations, enuies, croſſings and thwartings of his aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the afflictions and troubles which are incident to his calling and place.

For that by death (which dayly draweth on them) all men are depriued of all ſenſe, worke and labour of this life, to doe thencefoorth therein either good or euill.

<pb facs="tcp:7975:181"/>
Another dieth in the bitternes of his ſoule, and never eateth with pleaſure. Nevertheleſſe, they ſleepe both a like in the earth, and the wormes cover them.</hi> Thus are they both confounded, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily combined together. Yea, here <hi>Therſites</hi> the deformed, &amp; <hi>Nircus</hi> the moſt beautifull (as the very Gréeke Poets ſay) are worthily compared, as touching their bodies. Next to this, ſuch are alſo the confuſions and euents of this life, and humaine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in this words, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in the iudgement of the carnall man there is not diſcerned any difference at all between the good &amp; the euil the iuſt man and the ſinner, to either of the which the temporall good thinges of nature, fortune and life are often alike. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> our Father was rich: ſo was <hi>Pharao, Abimelech</hi> and the king of <hi>Sodom.</hi> Againe, <hi>Cain</hi> was an exile from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, ſo was <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer <hi>Sarah</hi> was faire and beautifull: ſo were the daughters of <hi>Cain. Shem</hi> was preſerued in the Arke with his Father <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah:</hi> ſo was <hi>Cham</hi> alſo within the ſame. But it may be ſo, that the Lord would therin teach, that his children ſhould ſerue him not inregard of thoſe temporall and worldly things: and again that the vngodly which alſo haue and do abuſe the ſame, might be left without all excuſe of their vnthankefulnes: that the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God might bee acknowledged and his word beleeued, which commendeth and promiſeth the future iudgement and full retribution of all mens wordes and workes, and that the worthines of faith might bee encreaſed. Moreouer it is ſo, that the true vertues of the ſpirit diuine (which are ſo well knowne of the king) do not externally appeare to the carnall minded man. Therefore the men of this world eſteeme no more of the iuſt and godly, then of the wicked and impious: yea, they perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the godly and moſt vertuous, and conſtraine them by their cruel tyrannies and oppreſſions to ſuffer and endure thoſe bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tormentes and paines which are only one, as well deſerued to malefactor and tranſgreſſours of the law. This thing was noted in the death of <hi>Habel</hi> whom <hi>Cain</hi> ſlew: in the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our father <hi>Iacob</hi> by <hi>Eſau</hi> by <hi>Laban,</hi> &amp; others wherof he could ſay to <hi>Pharao,</hi> that his dayes had beene few and euill: in the accuſation, the ſelling away, the impriſonment and afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of <hi>Ioſeph:</hi> in the afflictions of our fathers in Egypt, in the

Such is the entertainement of the godly and their common eſtimation in the world: and this is the nature of vanities kingdome! Now, what is that which ye diſliked in theſe the kings words <hi>No man hath power over the ſpirit to keepe ſtill the ſpirite nor hath any power in the time of death</hi>? Is it not a true ſaying?<label type="milestone">

                  <note place="margin">mans power of life. Cap. 8.8.</note> For hath any man power either to liue as long as he liſteth: or to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his ſoule from his body at his pleaſure? Surely it is true (as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaid to this purpoſe: <hi>The dayes of man are determined</hi> and as the King ſaid: <hi>The dayes of a man are numbred</hi>: that is sby the Lord who onely hath power either to giue, or to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way mans life at his will and pleaſure, at all times: and that neither this, nor that lieth in the will or power of man: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as he may not caſt himſelfe raſhly into danger: ſo neither ſhould he promiſe himſelf long life. Though <hi>Saul</hi> ſlew himſelfe he had not therein power of his life: for his dayes were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and now expired, he was ſhewed the day before,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 28.19.</note> that hee ſhould die, and in the manner of his death, he was, by the iuſtice of God, made his owne executioner. As he could retaine his life no longer, ſo neither could he forbeare to performe that on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, which he was in this iudgement conſtrayned to performe. If worldly men had this power either to retaine life, or to put it off, when they lifted, they would then often renew themſelues and old age would not be much diſlike: yea, death, which is ſo bitter to the wealthy men of this life, would not be ſo much feared, as it is. But now it falleth out otherwiſe: for why nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the courage and ſtrength of body preſerue the ſtrong warrier, nor the induſtry of arte, nor the deuiſes and counſailer of man withſtand death, when the Lord taketh away life, nor can force death on them, whom the Lord is willing ſo preſerue in life.

Howbeit as euery medicine helpes not euery nature, nor cureth euery patient (ſeeing againſt the ſtrength of death there is no phiſicke auaileable) the king coulde not (as himſelfe confeſſed) cure all thinges: for many thinges remaine imperfect, defectiue and incureable in vanities kingdome,<note place="margin">All thinges cannot be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this world.</note> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (howſoeuer the medicines are compounded and applied) may any man imagin that they can be ſalued and recured. But this fault is not long of the phiſician and his medicines, but of the euill conſtitution and nature of the patient and his griefes. * In the ſecond generall parte the King propoſeth the chiefe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> end of mans life in this worlde,<note place="margin">The chiefe good to be purſued.</note> which is <hi>The feare of God &amp; the keeping of his commandementes,</hi> and is indeede the dutie of every man, and that which by the law of Gods is required of all men. (as I ſaide before). And as in the former hee ſhewed what things moſt encreaſe mans vanity and miſcry: ſo here he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb facs="tcp:7975:184"/>
what they are which further him towardes his felicitie: And they are certain vertues which he oppoſeth to thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vices.<note place="margin">Certain ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded which further men towards hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines.</note> As namely the wiſdome of God ſpirit, prudence whereby a common wealth is gouerned, Iuſtice, obedience to laws and magiſtrates, modeſty, temperance, induſtry, dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, charity, patience in troubles, ſobriety, humilitie, fidelitie, truth, praier, liberalitie, iudgement, and to bee ſhort, <hi>pietie</hi> and the right ſeruice of God. And becauſe all thoſe thinges are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of a man in the opportune time, at the leaſt within the compaſſe of his humane life:<note place="margin">The benefit of time.</note> therefore he is carefull to counſel and aduiſe him to take the benefit of the time, and not to defer or put off from day to day to do &amp; perform that which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of him, leſt he bee ſodainely taken away and periſh, nor can at any time thencefoorth finde the like opportunitie to worke, and effect that, which hee ſhoulde haue done, and now at length (though all too late) hee is moſt willing to doe, if hee might haue a graunt of that libertie and time againe. Therefore hee hath ſaide, and ſaith it often to them that ſtand before him to heare his wiſedome: <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou takeſt in hand,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 9 9.</note> 
                  <hi>do it with all thy power: For in the grave wherevnto thou goeſt, there is neither worke, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, knowledge nor wiſedome.</hi> As if hee ſaid, there is no time allotted for men to worke and do the workes of their vocations after this life. They therefore that bee willing to ſerue GOD in their ſeuerall functions as they ought, muſt bee right diligent therein and obſerue their times in this life at the leaſt, and not deferre it to the life to com.

Neither doth hee aduenture to ſpeake or vtter any thing, before that hee hath with wiſedom conceiued it,
<pb facs="tcp:7975:189"/>
and with a perfect iudgement digeaſted it in his heart. For hée knoweth, that as in the ordinary courſe of nature, the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion goeth before the birth: ſo learning ought to goe before tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in him which is the teacher. Firſt therefore, he hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yea and yet he continueth a learner, that thereby he might the better know all things and frame himſelfe a <hi>Teacher.</hi> And to that end, he hath béene a diligent ſearcher of all Antiquities, and the worthieſt monuments of the ancient Fathers, hearke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therein to the counſaile of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 32.7.</note> where hee faith: <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the dayes of the world that is paſt: conſider the yeeres of ſo many generations, Aske thy father &amp; he will ſhew thee: thine Elders and they will tell thee.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Geneſis. Exodus. Levit. Num.

Nor is the King ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of this, that as the herbe <hi>Moly,</hi> which is ſo good and ſoueraigne for medicine beyonde many others, is very hardly digged or drawen vp from the earth: ſo thoſe things which are excellent (indéed) and of ſpeciall choice, come not to men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exquiſite ſtudie,<note place="margin">wiſedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is Gods guift, yet muſt men ſtudy &amp; labour for it.</note> and great and hard trauels: and that albeit the excellencie of wiſedome, knowledge and iudgement is not atchiued or gotten by any the wit, wiſedome, power, poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie or agilitie of man, but commeth from the Lordes goodneſſe and mercy: yet doth not the Lord ordinarily giue or beſtow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe things without the lawfull exerciſes of reaſon, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and diligence: but he is right willing to helpe and further the true labourers, to inſtruct them which reade aduiſedly, and to further them which haue a deſire to procéede faithfully in the way of his commandments: to, and for the which, he maketh his word a Lanterne vnto their fecte, and a light vnto their pathes. To this purpoſe, he giueth them Séers, wiſemen, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Prieſts and goodly Princes: and he powreth foorth of his
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7975:189"/>
diuine ſpirite, whereby they be made apt and capable of thoſe ſingular graces: Whereof wee haue many worthy examples, as namely, in <hi>Noah,</hi> in <hi>Lot,</hi> in <hi>Abraham,</hi> in <hi>Iacob,</hi> in <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> in <hi>Moſes,</hi> in <hi>Samuel,</hi> in the Kings father, and laſtly, in the King himſelfe, who in his youth (as the Lorde by his ſpirit had diſpoſed him) prayed vnto the Lord for wiſedome, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed himſelfe in the things which thereunto appertained: hearkened to <hi>David,</hi> to <hi>Bethſabe,</hi> to <hi>Nathan,</hi> to <hi>Gad,</hi> to <hi>Aſaph,</hi> and to his noble Counſailors: and vſed the reaſon and wiſedom which God gaue him, as a talent encreaſing. So God yet more and more proſpered him from day to day: hee taught him: he aduiſed him, he bleſſed him, and wiſdome was found of him that ſought for her. And thus vſeth the Lorde in his mercie and loue, to admoniſh ſuch as thinke of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and to comfort them which early enquire for him: he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth them that deſire to learne: hee heareth them that pray vnto him: he lighteneth them that diſpute of knowledge, hée openeth to them that knocke, and he giueth to them that aſke, that in things that be profitable, holy, and appertaining to the glory of his Name, to the good of his Church, to the benefite of his people. This the King (as hee is moſt wiſe) knoweth right well. And hauing thus gotten and attained the excellencie of wiſedome, he burieth not thoſe his Talents in the earth,<note place="margin">The vſe of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents and gifts which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth on men.</note> but employeth and occupieth the ſame: not like vnto that niggard, who for feare of looſing his wealth would hide it, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all vſe: nor like the enuious, which would not that other men ſhould be partakers of knowledge: but as the right libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall and charitable man, he laboureth &amp; endeuoreth to make all other men partakers of his wiſdome and diuine graces, and hideth her riches from no man.

For it is certaine, that as the eie is not ſatiſfied with ſéeing, nor the eare with hearing; and mans curioſitie being vnmeaſurable, the doctrines and opinions of men doe exceed in multitude and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie: ſo both the inuenting of thoſe doctrines and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in the making of thoſe Bookes, which are neither agreable, nor any way comparable to this one doctrine ſo giuen and approoued by the chiefe Paſtor and Teacher,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7975:190"/>
and alſo in the reading, ſtudying, learning and exerciſes thereof, are nothing els, but a <hi>labour of the fleſh,</hi> and a vexing of the minde: And ſo much the more, for that therein (among other things) this is holden and plauſibly accepted, that the <hi>chiefe felicitie of man,</hi> did conſiſt either of honors, or riches,<note place="margin">Men haue pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their chief felicitie in thoſe things of the world.</note> or of pleaſures and mens delights and ſuch like, the which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt men ſtudyed to attaine, in the reading, hearing and obſeruing the precepts and rules of the ſame.
